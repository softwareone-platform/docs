# Home Page

The Home page of the Client Portal consists of three main elements: a header, a footer, and a content area, which is divided into the following sections:

* Top Modules
* Account Information
* Favorites
* Recently Visited
* News and Updates

Each of these sections is explained in this topic. For information on the header and footer, see [Client Portal Interface](../navigate-the-home-page.md).

### Top modules

The top modules section displays our top 6 modules.  The list of modules is displayed based on your access permissions, which means that you can view the modules only if you have access to them.

Selecting the module name opens up the main page for the module.
