# Notifications

The **Notification** page, located under **Setup** > **Notifications** displays all notifications and allows you to manage them easily.  There are two types of notifications in the Client Portal:

* **System notifications** - These notifications are associated with your profile. You cannot subscribe or unsubscribe from these notifications.
* **User notifications** - These notifications are also called feature notifications. These notifications are sent only if you are subscribed to receive them.

By default, the system deletes all notifications after 30 days, regardless of whether you've read them.
