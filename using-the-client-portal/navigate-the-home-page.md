# Client Portal Interface

The Client Portal provides an easy-to-use experience that allows you to access different modules and features. The layout consists of three sections: Header, Content area, and Footer.

***

## Header

The header is global and displayed on all pages in the Client Portal.

* The left side of the header contains the SoftwareOne logo and the navigation menu. Selecting the logo at any time brings you back to the Home page of the Client Portal.
* The right side contains the [account menu](navigate-the-home-page.md#account-menu) that allows you to perform various actions.

### Navigation menu

The navigation menu gives you access to various modules and submodules. The menu is collapsed by default, but you can open it by selecting it.&#x20;

You can also use the menu to view your recently-viewed modules and favorites. For information on favorites, see [Manage Favorites](../account-settings/manage-favorites.md).

When you select a module from the navigation menu, all of the nested sub-modules are displayed.

### Account menu

The Account menu displays your name along with your organization name. Select your user name at the top-right corner of the page to display the menu.&#x20;

<div align="left">
