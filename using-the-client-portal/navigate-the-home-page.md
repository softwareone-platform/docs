# Client Portal Interface

The Client Portal provides an easy-to-use experience that allows you to discover and access the modules. The portal's layout consists of three sections: a horizontal header bar, the main content area, and a footer.&#x20;

## Header bar

The Header bar is global and displayed on all pages in the Client Portal.

* The left side of the header bar contains the SoftwareOne logo and a collapsible [navigation menu](navigate-the-home-page.md#navigation-menu). Selecting the logo at any time brings you back to the Home page of the Client Portal.
* The right side of the header bar contains the [account menu](navigate-the-home-page.md#account-menu) that allows you to perform various actions.

### Navigation menu

The navigation menu gives you access to various modules and submodules in the Client Portal. The menu is hidden by default, but you can open it by selecting it.&#x20;

From the navigation menu, you can also view your recently-viewed modules and [favorites](favorites.md).

When you select a module from the navigation menu, all of the nested submodules are displayed.

## Main content area

The main content area is the primary working area that displays data and allows you to complete your tasks.&#x20;

The layout of the content area is dependent on the module.  It can include elements, such as dashboards, tabs, panels, and tables.&#x20;
