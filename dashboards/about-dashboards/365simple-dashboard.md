# 365Simple Dashboard

***

The 365Simple dashboard provides an overview for customers taking advantage of SoftwareONE’s 365Simple service.

The dashboard provides:

* A single point of access to relevant parts of the platform (ie. invoices, user administration, collaboration site, etc.)
* Quarterly billing information
* Product usage
* Subscription assignment details
* Help & support tickets
* Service recommendations and articles

### Selecting your Tenant <a href="#selecting-your-tenant" id="selecting-your-tenant"></a>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you have multiple Microsoft tenants, you will see a dropdown next to your tenant name on the 365Simple dashboard, allowing you to switch between tenants.

When you switch tenants, the widget values in the dashboard will change accordingly.

As tenants are permission-based, some users may not see all available customer tenants.

Widgets like “Invoices”, “Add user” and “Service Review” are based on user or content permissions.

If you are unable to see the widgets, contact your administrator to check your permissions.

### Billing Information <a href="#billing-information" id="billing-information"></a>

This widget displays billing cycles from the past 90 days. It will usually contain the last 3 billing cycles, but it may also contain 4 if the billing cycle is spanning across two months.

If you hover over each billing cycle, you will see the billing date range, currency, subscription breakdown and total amount.

Clicking on the widget will take you to the “My Subscriptions” page where you can see more details.

**NOTE:** If you have multiple CSP agreements, this widget currently displays the default CSP agreements. Switching between agreements is currently not supported, but will be added.

### Product Usage & Subscriptions Assignment <a href="#product-usage-subscriptions-assignment" id="product-usage-subscriptions-assignment"></a>

In contrast to billing information, it is not possible to show usage and subscription assignments per agreement (this is not supported by vendors). Therefore “Product Usage” and “Top 5 Assigned Subscriptions” show information per Microsoft tenant (as noted on the yellow label within each widget).

The “Product Usage” widget provides you with an overview of active and inactive licenses and highlights opportunities to adjust the use vs. cost ratio. By clicking on the widget you are taken to 365Analytics where more in-depth analysis can be performed.

**Note:** Users without permission will not be able to access 365Analytics.

“Top 5 Subscriptions By Assigned” can also be used to evaluate subscription utilization and accompanying costs. Clicking on the widget will take you to a full consumption report where you can see a more detailed analysis.

### Service Recommendations & Articles <a href="#service-recommendations-articles" id="service-recommendations-articles"></a>

One of the biggest advantages for our customers is access to custom-tailored recommendations.

All 365Simple recommendations are provided directly, articles are written by SoftwareONE experts and backed by data-driven intelligence.

### Help and Support Overview <a href="#help-and-support-overview" id="help-and-support-overview"></a>

This widget provides a quick overview of all requests and incidents reported in the past 90 days including their respective status.

If no tickets have been logged, users will have the option to create a new request/incident.

Clicking on the widget takes you to the “Help and Support” page where all ticket details can be found.

### Recent Subscription Changes <a href="#recent-subscription-changes" id="recent-subscription-changes"></a>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This widget provides a quick overview of all subscription changes in the current month, ordered by biggest license seat count change.

If no changes are available, the widget will provide you with easy access to the “My Subscriptions” page.

### Recent News from Microsoft <a href="#recent-news-from-microsoft" id="recent-news-from-microsoft"></a>

365Simple customers can also quickly check the latest Microsoft 365 news without leaving the platform. Highly versatile filters can narrow down new features by products that are already rolled out, products that are planned, and products that are currently in development.

### Data Refresh Rate <a href="#data-refresh-rate" id="data-refresh-rate"></a>

As 365Simple surfaces data from multiple platform systems, there may be a difference in data refresh rate across the widgets. The below table describes each widget and its data refresh rate.

| **Widget**                      | **Refresh rate**                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |

| Recommendations                 | once a day                      |
| Product Usage                   | once a day                      |
| Top 5 Subscriptions by Assigned | once a day                      |
| Support tickets                 | every hour (after page refresh) |
