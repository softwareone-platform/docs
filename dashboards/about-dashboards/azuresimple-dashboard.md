# AzureSimple Dashboard

The AzureSimple dashboard provides an overview for customers taking advantage of SoftwareONE’s AzureSimple service.

The dashboard provides:

* A single point of access to relevant parts of the platform, including invoices, user administration, collaboration site, and so on.
* Savings opportunities
* Quarterly billing information
* Spike & outage alerts
* Help & support tickets
* Service articles

### Selecting your Tenant <a href="#selecting-your-tenant" id="selecting-your-tenant"></a>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (14) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you have multiple Microsoft tenants, you will see a dropdown option next to your tenant name on the AzureSimple dashboard, allowing you to switch between tenants.

When you switch tenants, the widget values in the dashboard will change accordingly.

As tenants are permission-based, some users may not see all available customer tenants.

Widgets like “Invoices”, “Add user” and “Service Review” are based on user or content permissions.

If you are unable to see the widgets, contact your administrator to check your permissions.

Clicking the widget will take you to the **Consumption Report** page where you can see more details.

**Note:** If you have multiple CSP agreements, this widget currently displays the default CSP agreement. Switching between agreements is currently not supported, but will be added.

### Spike & Outage Alerts <a href="#spike-outage-alerts" id="spike-outage-alerts"></a>

The Alerts widget displays the three latest and most severe alerts from the past 30 days.

This gives you the opportunity to address any unusual spending and prevent any further cost impact.

Clicking the widget takes you to the Notifications Hub where all other notifications can be found.

### Data Refresh Rate <a href="#data-refresh-rate" id="data-refresh-rate"></a>

As AzureSimple surfaces data from multiple platform systems, there may be a difference in data refresh rate across the widgets. The below table describes each widget and its data refresh rate.

| **Widget**                | **Refresh rate**                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Potential Monthly Savings | source is MS Azure Advisor, so in theory it could change every hour (after page refresh) |
| Billing                   | once a day                                                                               |
| Alerts                    | once a day                                                                               |
| Support tickets           | every hour (after page refresh)                                                          |
| Service Articles          | latest with every page refresh                                                           |
| Service Review            | latest with every page refresh                                                           |
