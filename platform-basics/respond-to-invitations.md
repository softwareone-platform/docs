When you've been invited to the Marketplace Platform by the SoftwareOne Operations team or your account administrator, you'll receive an email. You can accept the invitation to join the account or decline it.

## Accept an invitation

3. On the registration page, do the following:
   1. Enter your first name and last name.
   2. Enter a new password and then confirm that your new password matches the one you entered in the **Password** field. Passwords must be at least eight characters long, must contain at least one lowercase (a-z) and one uppercase letter (A-Z), a number, and a special character. When you enter a new password, our password validation checks whether your password meets the criteria.
   3. Select **I agree to the SoftwareOne Client Portal Terms of Use**.&#x20;
   4. Click **Accept invitation**.

5. [Sign in to your account](sign-in-to-your-account.md) using your email address and password.&#x20;

After signing in, you'll be redirected to the [Home](platform-interface/home-page.md) page. Depending on your groups and permissions (assigned by your administrator), you'll be able to access platform modules, view data, and complete your tasks.&#x20;

For information on how to navigate the Marketplace Platform, see [Platform interface](platform-interface/).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Invitation link has expired?**&#x20;

Invitation links are unique and they expire within seven (7) days of being issued. If your link has expired, your account administrator must create a new link. For more information, see [Generate a new invitation](../platform-modules/settings/users/generate-a-new-invitation.md).
{% endhint %}

## Decline an invitation

You can decline an invitation if it was sent to you in error or if you choose not to join the account.

To decline, open the invitation link and click **Decline invitation**.
