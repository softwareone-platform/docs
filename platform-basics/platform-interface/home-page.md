# Home page

The **Home** page consists of three main elements: header, footer, and main content area, which is further divided into the following sections:

* Top Modules
* Account Information
* Favorites
* Recently Visited
* News and Updates

Each of these sections is explained in this topic. For information on the header and footer, see [Platform Interface](./).

## Top modules

The top modules section displays our top 6 modules.  The list of modules is displayed based on your access permissions, which means that you can view the module names only if you are authorized to access them.

When you select a tile, the main page for the module opens.
