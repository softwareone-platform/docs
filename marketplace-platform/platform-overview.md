# Platform Overview

## What is the Marketplace Platform?

The Marketplace Platform represents a modern approach to software procurement, offering a comprehensive set of modules and features that simplify software procurement for enterprises.

It's designed to simplify the complexity of managing relationships and building a digital business network that connects clients with vendors in a consistent manner, providing standardized billing capabilities, streamlined procurement processes, vendor management, and more.

The platformâ€™s functionality is further augmented by a public API and SDK, which enables automation and allows developers and system integrators to access the platform programmatically.&#x20;
