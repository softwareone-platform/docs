# How to Verify If Your Account Has Partner Capabilities

There are three ways to verify whether your account is configured as a partner account within the Marketplace Platform.&#x20;

You can check this through the following pages, available under **Settings** in the main navigation menu:

1. **Accounts** - The [Accounts](../../../modules-and-features/settings/account/) page displays general information about your account. If you are set up as a SoftwareOne partner, you'll see a field labeled **Partner program** with the value **Yes** in the **Additional Data** section on the **General** tab. This field does not appear for client accounts.
2. **Buyers** - The [Buyers ](../../../modules-and-features/settings/buyers/)page lists all entities or organizations that have been configured for your Marketplace account. For partner accounts, this page displays all organizations that will receive invoices from SoftwareOne.
3. **Licensees** - On the [Licensees](../../../modules-and-features/settings/licensees/) page, partners can view their own organizations as well as third-party organizations. The **Resale** column indicates whether a licensee is procuring for self-consumption or reselling. If the value in the **Resale** column is **Yes**, it means the licensee will order products and services for resale purposes.
