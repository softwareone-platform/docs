# How to Configure Resale Licensees

SoftwareOne partners who wish to order products for reselling must have a licensee configured as a Resale Licensee within the account.&#x20;

A resale licensee indicates that the licensee has been set up for reselling the product instead of self-consumption.

**To create a new licensee for resale arrangement:**

1. Navigate to the **Licensees** page and click **Add**. The **Add licensee** page opens.&#x20;
2. Specify the General information:
   * **Logo** - (Optional) Add a logo for the licensee. You can upload an image or drag the image into the field.
   * **Licensee name** - (Required) Provide the licensee's name. This can be your company name, department name, or username.&#x20;
   * **Resale licensee** - (Optional) Select this checkbox to enable resale transactions for the licensee. Resale licensees can order software products and services specifically for resale activities.
   * **External reference** - (Optional) Enter a reference number or identifier for the licensee.
   * **Licensee description** - (Optional) Add a description for the licensee.
3. On the **Buyers** page, select a buyer for your transactions.
4. On the **Sellers** page, select the seller or SoftwareOne entity that will facilitate the transactions. Click **Next**.
5. On the **Contact person** page, choose if you want to assign a contact person to the licensee:
   * **None (leave unassigned)** - Select this option if you don't want to assign a contact person.
   * **Select an account user** - Select this option to assign an existing user as the contact person.
   * **Add contact details manually** - Select this option to enter the details manually. You must provide the person's name, email address, and optional contact details.
6. On the **Address** page, choose the licensee's address. You can use the same address as that of the buyer or select **Create a new licensee address** to enter a new address.&#x20;
7. On the **Review** page, review the details and then click **Add**.&#x20;

The licensee is created as a resale licensee and is displayed on the **Licensees** page.&#x20;
