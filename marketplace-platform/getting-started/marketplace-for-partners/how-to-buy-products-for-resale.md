# How to Buy Products for Resale

The **Products** page in the Marketplace Platform displays all products that are available for ordering. This includes products for self-consumption and reselling to other businesses.&#x20;

The first step in the ordering process is to choose whether you want to use your existing agreement with SoftwareOne or create a new one. New agreements give you the flexibility to select a licensee based on the consumption model (reselling or self-use) and then complete the buying process. If you choose to use an existing agreement, you'll need to make sure that your selected agreement is linked to a Resale Licensee.&#x20;

To order a product for resale:

1. Sign in to your account and navigate to the **Products** page.
2. Select the relevant product and click **Buy now** in the upper right. The ordering process begins.
3. On the **Select agreements** page, select **Create agreement**.
4. On the **Select licensee** page, choose a licensee from the list. Make sure that the licensee has been configured as a resale licensee.
5. Select **Next**. On the **Select certificate** page, choose the certificate to use. Only active certificates can be selected.
