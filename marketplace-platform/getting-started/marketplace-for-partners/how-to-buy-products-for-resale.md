# How to Buy Products for Resale

The **Products** page in the Marketplace Platform displays all products that are available for partners to order. This includes products for self-consumption and reselling to other businesses.&#x20;

The first step in the ordering process is to choose whether you want to use an existing agreement or create a new one. New agreements give you the flexibility to select a licensee based on the consumption model (reselling or self-use) and then complete the buying process. If you choose to use an existing agreement, you'll need to make sure that the agreement is mapped to a Resale Licensee.&#x20;
