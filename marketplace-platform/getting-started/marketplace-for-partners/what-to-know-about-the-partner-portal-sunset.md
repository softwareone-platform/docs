# What to Know About the Partner Portal Sunset

The One Club portal, also known as the Partner Portal, has been discontinued and is no longer accessible. All partner activities previously handled in One Club are now managed through the [SoftwareOne Marketplace Platform](https://portal.platform.softwareone.com/).

### What has been migrated

All of your active [subscriptions](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/subscriptions/) and [agreements](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/agreements/) from One Club have been migrated and are available in the Marketplace Platform.

You can access these resources immediately after signing in to your Marketplace account.

### What hasn't been migrated

Your historical order data and billing reports weren't migrated.&#x20;

This means if you need to look up past orders or access historical billing information, you will not find those in the new platform.

### What are the updates to the API

* **Legacy API** - The legacy One Club API has been retired and is no longer available. All API endpoints from the legacy system have been discontinued, so if you were using the old API for integrations, you must transition to the new API.
* **New API** - A new, modern API is now available for the Marketplace Platform. The [new API](../../../developer-resources/rest-api/openapi-specification.md) offers a modern RESTful architecture with improved security and authentication features. It also provides enhanced functionality that's fully aligned with the platform, giving you more capabilities than the legacy API.

### What to do next

Now that the OneClub portal is retired, you must start using the Marketplace Platform for all your operations. Your subscriptions and agreements are already there waiting for you, so you can pick up right where you left off.

If you are using APIs for integrations, take some time to review the [REST API documentation](../../../developer-resources/rest-api/). The new API is designed to be intuitive and well-documented, ensuring a straightforward transition.

We understand that platform changes can be challenging, and we are committed to making this transition seamless. If you have any questions or require assistance, [Marketplace Platform Support ](../../../help-and-support/contact-support.md)is here to help you.
