# How to Order Products for Resale

The tutorial describes how you can order products for resale through the Marketplace Platform.&#x20;

When ordering products, there are two options for agreements:

* If you have an existing agreement, you can use that agreement. However, you'll need to make sure that the agreement is mapped to a licensee configured as a resale licensee.&#x20;
* If you don't have an agreement, you can create one during the ordering process and select an existing licensee configured as a resale licensee.

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

* A resale licensee in the active state, or permission to [create a new licensee](how-to-configure-licensees-for-resale.md) if you don't want to use the existing one. Licensee selection is required when setting up a new agreement.&#x20;
* Company details of your client, like the company name, registration ID, and address. These details are required for creating a new Microsoft tenant.&#x20;
* The contact details of your client who will manage the Microsoft account.&#x20;
