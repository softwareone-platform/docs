# How to Order Products for Resale

The tutorial describes the process of ordering products for resale through the Marketplace Platform.&#x20;

In the Marketplace Platform, agreements are the foundation for placing orders and creating subscriptions. Without an agreement, you cannot place an order. Therefore, when ordering products, there are two options when it comes to agreements:

* If you have an existing agreement, you can use that agreement. However, you'll need to make sure that the agreement is mapped to a licensee that's been configured for resale. If the agreement doesn't have a resale licensee, the transaction will not be allowed.
* If you don't have an agreement, you can create one during the ordering process and select the **Resale licensee** to use for this new agreement.
