# How to Order Products for Resale

The tutorial describes the process of ordering products for resale through the Marketplace Platform.&#x20;

In the Marketplace Platform, agreements are the foundation for placing orders and creating subscriptions. Without an agreement, orders cannot be placed.&#x20;

When ordering products, there are two options for agreements:

* If you have an existing agreement, you can use that agreement. However, you'll need to make sure that the agreement is mapped to a licensee that's been configured for resale. If the agreement doesn't have a resale licensee, the transaction will not be allowed.
* If you don't have an agreement, you can create one during the ordering process and select an existing licensee you've configured for resale.
