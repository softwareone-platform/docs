# How to Configure Licensees for Resale

This tutorial describes how SoftwareOne partners can set up resale licensees within the platform.

Licensees are the entities that use the software products or services procured by the buyer. Partners who wish to order products from the Marketplace and resell them to other organizations must configure these licensees as resale licensees.&#x20;

A resale licensee is defined as a licensee that engages in resale activities, specifically ordering products for resale rather than for their self consumption.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have permissions to create new licensees. Only account administrators can create and manage licensees in the platform.
