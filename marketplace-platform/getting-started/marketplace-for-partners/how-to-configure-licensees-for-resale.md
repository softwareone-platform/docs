# How to Configure Licensees For Resale

In the Marketplace Platform, licensees are the entities that consume the software products or services procured by the buyer.&#x20;

SoftwareOne Partners who want to order products from the Marketplace and resell them to other organizations must configure licensees as resale licensees. A resale licensee is a licensee that's involved in resale activities, ordering products specifically for resale instead of self-consumption.

This topic explains how partners can set up resale licensees on the platform.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have permissions to create licensees. Only account administrators can create and manage licensees in the platform.

## Configuring licensees for resale

Partners can set up resale licensees through the **Licensees** page. After you have configured a licensee as a resale licensee, you cannot modify this setting.&#x20;

To configure a licensee for resale:

1. Navigate to the **Licensees** page on the platform. Then, select **Add** to start the **Add licensee** wizard.
2. In the **General** step, enter the following details and then select **Next**:&#x20;
   * **Logo** - (Optional) Add a logo for the licensee. You can upload an image or drag the image into the field.
   * **Licensee name** - (Required) Provide a name for the licensee, which could be your company name, department name, or username.&#x20;
   * **Resale licensee** - (Optional) Select this checkbox to configure the license as a resale licensee, so they can order software products and services for resale.&#x20;
   * **External reference** - (Optional) Enter a reference number or identifier for the licensee.
   * **Licensee description** - (Optional) Provide a brief description of the licensee.
3. In the **Buyers** step, choose the buying entity you want to link with the license, then select **Next**.&#x20;
4. In the **Sellers** step, choose the SoftwareOne entity you want to order from. Only the sellers that are mapped to the buyer you've selected in the previous step are displayed. When done, select **Next**.
5. In the **Contact person** step, choose if you want to assign a contact person to the licensee, then select **Next**:
   * **None (leave unassigned)** - Choose this if you don't want to assign a contact person.
   * **Select an account user** - Choose this to assign an existing user within your account as the contact person.
   * **Add contact details manually** - Choose this to enter the details manually. You'll need to provide the person's name, email address, and optional contact details.
6. In the **Address** step, the **Create a new licensee address** option is selected by default. Enter the address for the new licensee and select **Next**.&#x20;
7. Review all the details and select **Add**.&#x20;

The licensee is created as a resale licensee. Select **View details** to open the licensee details page. Otherwise, select **Close**.&#x20;
