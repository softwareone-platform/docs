# How to Configure Licensees For Resale

In the Marketplace Platform, licensees are the entities that consume the software products or services procured by the buyer.&#x20;

SoftwareOne Partners who want to order products from the Marketplace and resell them to other organizations must configure licensees as resale licensees. A resale licensee is a licensee that's involved in resale activities, ordering products specifically for resale instead of self-consumption.

This topic explains how partners can set up resale licensees in the platform.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have access permissions to create licensees. Only account administrators can create and manage licensees in the platform.

## Configuring licensees for resale

Partners can set up resale licensees through the **Licensees** page in the platform. Note that once you have configured a licensee for resale, you cannot modify this setting.&#x20;

To configure a licensee for resale:

1. Navigate to the **Licensees** page and select **Add** to start the **Add licensee** wizard.
2. On the **General** page, enter the following details and then select **Next**:&#x20;
   * **Logo** - (Optional) Add a logo for the licensee. You can upload an image or drag the image into the field.
   * **Licensee name** - (Required) Provide a name for the licensee, which could be your company name, department name, or username.&#x20;
   * **Resale licensee** - (Optional) Select this checkbox to allow the licensee to order software products and services for resale.&#x20;
   * **External reference** - (Optional) Provide a reference number or identifier for the licensee.
   * **Licensee description** - (Optional) Provide a brief description of the licensee.
3. On the **Buyers** page, choose the buying entity that you want to link with the license, then select **Next**.&#x20;
4. On the **Sellers** page, choose the SoftwareOne entity you want to order from and select **Next**. Note that this list only displays the sellers associated with your selected buyer.&#x20;
5. On the **Contact person** page, choose if you want to assign a contact person to the licensee, then select **Next**:
   * **None (leave unassigned)** - Choose this if you don't want to assign a contact person.
   * **Select an account user** - Choose this to assign an existing user within your account as the contact person.
   * **Add contact details manually** - Choose this to enter the details manually. You'll need to provide the person's name, email address, and optional contact details.
6. On the **Address** page, the **Create a new licensee address** option is selected by default. Enter the address for the new licensee and select **Next**.&#x20;
7. Review the details and select **Add**.&#x20;

Your new licensee is established as a resale licensee. Select **View** to open the licensee details page. Otherwise, select **Close** to exit the wizard.&#x20;
