# What is Partners Management?

SoftwareOne is a global provider of software and cloud technology solutions. Our [Partner program ](https://partner.softwareone.com/welcome)helps companies that sell cloud-based products and services expand their businesses by accessing new markets around the world.&#x20;

The program supports partners such as Value-Added Resellers (VARs), System Integrators (SIs), and Managed Service Providers (MSPs), and other businesses like Cloud Solutions Providers (CSPs), Direct Marketing Resellers (DMRs), and Retailers to grow their revenue and scale their market presence. It provides the necessary training and support, tools, and educational resources for these partners to accelerate growth, reach new clients, and build long-term relationships while minimizing the risks associated with competitive solutions.&#x20;

A key feature of the program is Partners Management, available through the Marketplace Platform.&#x20;

Unlike clients, who procure software or services for their own consumption, partners can procure SaaS products for both their own consumption and for resale to their customer base. This can be done through the Marketplace Platform, which supports two different consumption models: self-use and resale. After signing in to the Marketplace Platform, partners have access to various functionalities, as well as specific features designed to support resale activities.&#x20;

The distinction between the two consumption models is made at the licensee level in the platform. Licensees are the end-users or consumers of a license, and they are linked to specific agreements. Partners can easily set up new licensees through the interface and designate them as Resale Licensees. By marking a licensee as a Resale Licensee, partners indicate that they'll be reselling our products and services to external companies rather than using them for their own consumption.&#x20;

Once configured, these resale licensees can be selected during the ordering process for resale products.
