**Marketplace Platform and Partners Management**

Partners Management in the Marketplace Platform allows partners to access specific features designed to support resale activities. &#x20;

Unlike clients, who procure software or services for their own use, partners can procure SaaS products for their own use as well as resale to their customers. The distinction is made at the licensee level.

Licensees are the end-users or consumers of a license, and they are linked to agreements in the platform. Partners can create new licensees through self-service and configure them as resale licensees. Once marked for resale, these licensees appear in the ordering process. Selecting a resale licensee indicates that you will resell our products and services to external companies rather than using them for your self use.&#x20;

**Partner enrollments and certificates**

Partners Management also enables partners to enrol in programs, complete certifications, and apply those certificates when ordering products to avail the benefits associated with those programs.&#x20;
