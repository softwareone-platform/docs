# How to Change License Quantity

The Marketplace Platform gives you the flexibility to upsize or downsize your licenses at any time.&#x20;

If you need more licenses, you can alter the subscription to add additional licenses. You can also lower the number of licenses if you no longer require all of your ordered licenses.

When reducing the number of licenses, the following rules apply:&#x20;

* If your subscription contains only one item, you can't lower the quantity of this item to zero. In this case, you must terminate the subscription.&#x20;
* If your subscription contains multiple items, at least one item must have a quantity greater than zero. You can't change the quantity of all items to zero.

## Adding or removing licenses

To add or remove licenses from a subscription:

1. Navigate to the **Subscriptions** page in the platform.
2. Select the required subscription.
3. On the subscription details page, select **Edit** to start the **Edit subscription** wizard.&#x20;
4. In the **Items** step, update the quantity in the **New qty** field. You'll notice that the sales price of the subscription changes as you adjust the quantity. When done, select **Next**.
5. In the **Details** step, add or update the reference ID and your comments as necessary. Then, select **Next**.
6. In the **Review** step, check the details and select **Place Order**.

A change order is created in the system and sent to the vendor for processing. The new change order is also displayed in your list of orders on the **Orders** page.&#x20;

When the change order is being processed, the status of the subscription and the agreement change to **Updating**. This indicates that the agreement is temporarily locked, and no further orders can be placed under this agreement until the change order is completed.
