# How to change license quantity in your subscription

If you need more licenses for an existing subscription, you can modify the subscription to increase the number of licenses. You can also reduce the quantity if you no longer require all of your ordered licenses.

When reducing your licenses, there are a few important points to consider:

* If your subscription contains one item, you cannot reduce the quantity to zero. In this case, you must terminate the subscription. To learn more, see [Terminate subscriptions](../../../modules/marketplace/subscriptions/terminate-a-subscription.md).
* If your subscription contains multiple items, at least one item must have a quantity greater than zero. It's not possible to change the quantity of all items to zero.

## Increasing or decreasing license quantity

To increase or decrease the quantity of licenses:

1. Sign in to your account and navigate to the **Subscriptions** page (**Marketplace** > **Subscriptions**).&#x20;
2. Select the required subscription.&#x20;
3. When the details page of your selected subscription opens, click **Edit** in the upper right.&#x20;

4. In the **Edit subscription** wizard, update the quantity as needed in the **New qty** field. Click **Next** to continue.
5. Update the reference ID and notes. These details are optional. Click **Next** to continue.
6. Review the details including prices and then click **Place Order** to finalize.&#x20;

A change order is created in the system and sent to the vendor for processing. You can see the order on the **Orders** page.&#x20;

While the change order is processing, the subscription and the agreement will have the status as **Updating**. It means that the agreement is temporarily locked, and no further orders can be placed under this agreement until the current change order is completed.
