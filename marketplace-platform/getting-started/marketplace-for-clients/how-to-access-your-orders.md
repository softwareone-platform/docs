# How to Access Your Orders

Once you've placed an order through the Marketplace Platform, it's displayed on the **Orders** page. The platform supports various types of orders including change orders, purchase orders, and terminate orders, all of which are visible on the **Orders** page.&#x20;

If you need to find a specific order, you can use the filter option to refine your list of orders. We provide several filter options that you can use to narrow down the orders.&#x20;

## Using filters to find an order

You can use a single filter or create a combination of filters by selecting different fields, operators, and values.

1. Sign in to your account and go to the **Orders** page (**Marketplace** > **Orders**).

2. On the **Orders** page, select the **Filter** option.&#x20;
3. When the filter box displays, click **Add another condition** to open a menu of conditions.&#x20;
4. Define the conditions:
   1. In the first field, choose the condition. For example, to filter your orders by their status, choose **Status**.
   2. In the second field, select the search operator. Different operators are displayed depending on the condition you selected in the first field. For this example, leave the value set to **Equal**.
   3. In the third field, type or select a value from the list of preconfigured values. The values displayed in this field are determined by your selection in the first field. To see your draft orders, select **Draft**.

Your orders will be automatically refreshed based on the conditions you've set. To display another condition row, click **Add another condition** and then specify additional conditions as needed.

To reset the filters and revert to the default view, select **Reset filters** in the filter box.&#x20;

## Viewing your order's details

If you want to get detailed information for an order, click the order number.&#x20;

You'll then be able to view the items that are a part of your order, associated parameters, subscriptions, and more.

Additionally, depending on the type of order, you'll be able to take various actions, such as:

* [Manage the notes within your order and update them as necessary.](../../../modules/marketplace/orders/manage-order-notes.md)
* [View all files attached to your order and download those files.](../../../modules/marketplace/orders/view-and-download-attachments.md)
* [Delete orders that are in the Draft state.](../../../modules/marketplace/orders/delete-draft-orders.md)
* [Change the status of your order to Processing](../../../modules/marketplace/orders/set-an-order-to-processing.md).
