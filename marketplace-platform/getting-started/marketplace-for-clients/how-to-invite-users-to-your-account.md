# How to Invite Users to Your Account

Account administrators can invite new users to the account from the **Users** page under **Settings** in the main menu.

They can invite existing platform users and individuals who don't yet have an account.&#x20;

When an administrator adds someone to the account, an invitation to join is emailed. It's important to take action once you receive the invitation, as account invitations are valid for only 7 days from the send date. After 7 days, invitations expire and will need to be resent.&#x20;

## Inviting users to your account

Administrators can invite users through the **Add** option, which is located in the upper right on the **Users** page.

In **Add user**, complete the required sections. You'll need to enter **user details**, such as the user's full name and email address, and select the **groups** you want to assign to the user.&#x20;

Next, confirm the information displayed on the **Overview** page, and then click **Add**. For detailed instructions, see [Add New Users](../../../modules-and-features/settings/users/add-new-users.md).&#x20;

The individual will receive an email invitation, which they must accept within 7 days to join the account. To learn about accepting invites and account registration, see [Respond to Invitations](../../../modules-and-features/settings/users/respond-to-invitations.md).
