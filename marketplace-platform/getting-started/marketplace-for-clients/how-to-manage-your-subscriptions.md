# How to Manage Your Subscriptions

Subscription management through self-service is one of the key features of our platform, providing you with the flexibility to order and manage your subscriptions.&#x20;

Through the Marketplace, you can easily order new subscriptions, increase or decrease the number of licenses, and place termination orders to cancel your subscriptions. You also have the option to edit the subscription name and manage renewals.&#x20;

## Viewing your subscription and subscription details

You can view your subscriptions on the **Subscriptions** page. The page displays all subscriptions that you ordered, regardless of their status.

To view the details of an individual subscription, select the subscription to open its details page.

## Adding or removing licenses

You can change the quantity of licenses by creating a change order through the platform.&#x20;

Change orders are required if you want to order additional licenses or lower the number of your existing licenses. For instructions, see [How to change license quantity](adjust-subscription-quantity.md).

## Terminating subscriptions

You can cancel a single subscription in an agreement or all subscriptions by placing a termination order. Subscriptions can't be canceled without a termination order.

* To cancel a single subscription, use the **Terminate** option on the subscription details page. For instructions, see [Terminate Subscription](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/subscriptions/terminate-a-subscription.md).
* To cancel all subscriptions in an agreement, place a termination order for the agreement. For instructions, see [Terminate Agreement](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/agreements/terminate-agreements.md).
