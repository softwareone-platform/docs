# How to Manage Your Subscriptions

Subscription management through self-service is one of the key features of our platform, providing you with the flexibility to manage your subscriptions.&#x20;

it means you can easily order new subscriptions, increase or decrease your licenses, and cancel subscriptions. You also have the option to edit the name of your subscription and modify subscription IDs, if needed.

## Viewing your subscription and subscription details

You can view your subscriptions by selecting the main menu of the Client Portal and then choosing **Marketplace** > **Subscriptions**.&#x20;

The page displays the important information regarding your subscriptions. To view the details of an individual subscription, click the subscription name. For more information, see [Subscriptions Interface](../../../modules/marketplace/subscriptions/subscriptions-interface.md).

## Editing subscription licenses

If you want to change the quantity of items in your subscription, you can do this by placing a change order. You can edit the subscription to make these changes.

For instance, if you need more licenses, you can update the quantity of licenses in the subscription. The same process applies if you want to lower your licenses.

For detailed instructions, see [How to change license quantity](adjust-subscription-quantity.md).

## Adding new subscription items&#x20;

If you want to add a new item to your subscription, you can edit the agreement. It means if you want to purchase new items, you don't need to create a new agreement. You can simply edit your agreement to include the new items.

This can be done through the **Buy more** option on the agreement's details page. For detailed instructions, see [How to add new items to your agreement](add-items-to-an-agreement.md).

## Terminating subscriptions

If you want to cancel a single subscription or all subscriptions in an agreement, you'll need to place a termination order. Without a termination order, subscriptions cannot be cancelled.&#x20;

You can cancel a single subscription using the **Terminate** option on the details page of the subscription. However, to cancel all subscriptions in your agreement, you must terminate the entire agreement.&#x20;

To learn more about canceling a single subscription, see [Terminate subscriptions](how-to-manage-your-subscriptions.md#terminating-subscriptions). To cancel all subscriptions in your agreement, see [Terminate Agreements](../../../modules/marketplace/agreements/terminate-agreements.md).
