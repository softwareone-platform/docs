# How to Manage Your Subscriptions

Subscription management through self-service is one of the key features of our platform, providing you with the flexibility to manage your subscriptions.&#x20;

It means you can easily order new subscriptions, increase or decrease your licenses, and cancel subscriptions. You also have the option to edit the name of your subscription and modify subscription IDs if needed.

## Viewing your subscription and subscription details

You can view your subscriptions on the **Subscriptions** page in the platform. The page displays all subscriptions in your account.&#x20;

To view the details of an individual subscription, select the subscription name. For information on the columns that are displayed on this page, see [Subscriptions](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/subscriptions/).

## Adding or removing licenses

You can change the license quantity by creating a change order through the platform.&#x20;

Change orders are required if you wish to order additional licenses or lower the number of licenses. For information, see [How to change license quantity](adjust-subscription-quantity.md).

## Terminating subscriptions

You can cancel a single or all subscriptions in an agreement by placing a termination order. Subscriptions cannot be canceled without a termination order.

* To cancel a single subscription, use the **Terminate** option on the subscription details page. For instructions, see [Terminate Subscription](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/subscriptions/terminate-a-subscription.md).
* To cancel all subscriptions in an agreement, place a termination order for the agreement. For instructions, see [Terminate Agreement](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/agreements/terminate-agreements.md).
