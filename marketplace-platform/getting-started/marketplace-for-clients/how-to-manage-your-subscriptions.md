# How to Manage Your Subscriptions

Subscription management through self-service is a key feature of the Marketplace Platform, giving you the flexibility to order new subscriptions and manage the existing ones.

You can order new subscriptions through self-service, increase or decrease the number of licenses, and cancel your subscription. You can also edit the subscription name and manage renewals.&#x20;

## Viewing your subscription and subscription details

All subscriptions are listed on the **Subscriptions** page. The page displays all subscriptions, regardless of their status.

To open the details page for a subscription, select the subscription name.

## Adding or removing licenses

You can change the quantity of licenses by creating a change order through the platform.&#x20;

Change orders are required if you want to order additional licenses or lower the number of your existing licenses. For instructions, see [How to change license quantity](adjust-subscription-quantity.md).

## Terminating subscriptions

You can cancel a single subscription in an agreement or all subscriptions by placing a termination order. Subscriptions can't be canceled without a termination order.

* To cancel a single subscription, use the **Terminate** option on the subscription details page. For instructions, see [Terminate Subscriptions](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/subscriptions/terminate-a-subscription.md).
* To cancel all subscriptions in an agreement, terminate the agreement. For instructions, see [Terminate Agreement](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/agreements/terminate-agreements.md).
