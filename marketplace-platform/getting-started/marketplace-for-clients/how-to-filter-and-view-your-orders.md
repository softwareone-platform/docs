# How to filter and view your orders

Once you've placed an order through the Marketplace Platform, it's displayed on the **Orders** page.  The platform supports various types of orders including change orders, purchase orders, and terminate orders, all of which are visible on the page.&#x20;

## Using filters to find an order

If you need to find a specific order on the **Orders** page, you can use the filter option to refine your list of orders. We provide several filter options for you to narrow down your list of orders. You can use a single filter or create a combination of different filters by selecting different fields, operators, and values.

1. Sign in to your account and go to **Marketplace** > **Orders.**

2. On the **Orders** page, select the **Filter** option.&#x20;
3. When the filter box displays, click **Add another condition** to open a menu of conditions.&#x20;
4. Define the conditions:
   1. In the first field, choose the condition. For example, to filter your orders by their status, choose **Status**.
   2. In the second field, select the search operator. Depending on the condition you selected in the first field, different operators are displayed. If you chose **Status** in the first field, leave the value as **Equal**.
   3. In the third field, type or select a value from the list of preconfigured values (for example, to see your draft orders, select **Draft**). Note that the values displayed in this field are determined by your selection in the first field.&#x20;

Your orders will be automatically refreshed based on the conditions you've set. To display another condition row, click **Add another condition** and then specify additional conditions as needed.

To reset the filters, select **Reset filters**.&#x20;

## Viewing your order's details

If you want to get detailed information for an order, click the order number. You'll then be able to view the items that are included in your order, various parameters, subscriptions, and more.

Additionally, depending on the type of order, you'll be able to take various actions, like:

* [Managing the notes within your order and update them as necessary.](../../../modules/marketplace/orders/manage-order-notes.md)
* [Viewing all files attached to your order and download those files.](../../../modules/marketplace/orders/view-and-download-attachments.md)
* [Deleting orders that are in the Draft state.](../../../modules/marketplace/orders/delete-draft-orders.md)
* [Changing the status of your order to Processing](../../../modules/marketplace/orders/set-an-order-to-processing.md).
