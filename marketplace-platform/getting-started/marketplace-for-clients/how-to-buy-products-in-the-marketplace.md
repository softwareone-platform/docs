# How to Buy Products in the Marketplace

The Marketplace Platform is a centralized hub designed to streamline the discovery and ordering of subscription-based software products.&#x20;

The platform simplifies the complex process of software licensing and procurement, making it easier for you to find and compare products from multiple software vendors in one place. Each product on our marketplace undergoes a process, where vendors define the product including its terms of use, and submit it to SoftwareOne. Products become available for ordering only after they have been accepted by SoftwareOne.

## Accessing the marketplace

You can access the SoftwareOne Marketplace by signing in to your account and selecting **Marketplace** > **Products** from the main menu.

## Browsing and selecting products

The **Products** page shows all the products that are available for you to order. The page displays products by the vendor name and a brief product description.&#x20;

To view detailed information about a product, click the product name.

You'll then see detailed product information, including the product's terms and conditions, pricing information, and more. See [Products Interface](../../../modules/marketplace/products/products-interface.md) for more information.

## Placing an order&#x20;

Once you've reviewed the product details and selected the product you want to buy, you can start the ordering process by clicking **Buy now**.&#x20;

When you click the button, the Purchase Wizard opens. The wizard is designed to help you create a purchase order by guiding you through all the necessary steps.

Note that the steps will vary depending on the product you are ordering and the product vendor. At a high level, you'll need to complete the following steps:

1. **Select an agreement** - Select whether you want to use an existing agreement or create a new one. The option you select in this step determines the next step in the wizard.
   * If you are creating a new agreement, the **Select licensee** section opens.&#x20;
   * If you are using an existing agreement, the **Select items** section opens.
2. **Select a licensee** - Choose a licensee from the list of your licensees or create a new one.
3. **Provide agreement details** - Fill out the contact form.
4. **Select items** - Choose the items you want to order and the quantity of those items.
5. **Add reference details** - Add the optional order and agreement details.&#x20;
6. **Review order** - Preview the order details and then click **Place order** to finalize.
7. **Review summary** - See your order summary and the latest status message.
