**Submitting the order**

The ordering steps and the information you need to provide might vary depending on the product and its vendor. At a high level, you'll need to complete these steps:&#x20;

1. **Select agreement** - You have the option to either select an existing agreement or create a new one. The option you select in this step determines the next step. For example, if you create a new agreement, the **Select licensee** step is displayed. However, if you select an existing agreement, the **Select items** step appears.
2. **Select licensee** - You can either choose an existing licensee or create a new one.&#x20;
3. **Agreement details** - You may need to complete the contact form containing details, such as your company name, address, and more.&#x20;
4. **Select items** - You can choose all the items you want to order and adjust the quantity for each item.
5. **Additional information** - You can enter reference details, like additional IDs for both the order and the agreement.&#x20;
6. **Review order** - You can review the order details, read the terms and conditions, and then submit your order.
7. **Summary** - You can review your order summary to ensure everything is correct.
