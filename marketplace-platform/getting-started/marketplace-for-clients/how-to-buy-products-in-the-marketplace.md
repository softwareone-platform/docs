# How to buy products in the Marketplace

The Marketplace Platform is a centralized hub designed to streamline the discovery and ordering of subscription-based software products.&#x20;

The platform simplifies the complex process of software licensing and procurement, making it easier for you to find and compare products from different software vendors in one place. Each product on our marketplace undergoes a process, where vendors define the product including its terms of use, and submit it to SoftwareOne. Products become available for ordering only after SoftwareOne accepts them.

## Accessing the marketplace

You can access the SoftwareOne Marketplace by signing in to your account and selecting **Marketplace** > **Products** from the main menu.

## Exploring and selecting products

The **Products** page shows all products that are available for you to order. The page displays products according to the vendor name, and it also shows a brief product description.&#x20;

To view detailed information about a product, click the product name.

You'll then be able to view detailed product information, including the product's terms and conditions, pricing information, and more. For more information, see [Products Interface](../../../modules/marketplace/products/products-interface.md).&#x20;

## Placing an order&#x20;

After you've read through the product details and chosen the product you want to buy, you can start the ordering process by clicking **Buy now**.&#x20;

When you click the button, the Purchase Wizard opens. The wizard is designed to help you in creating a purchase order by completing all of the necessary steps.&#x20;

Note that the steps will vary depending on the product you are ordering and the product's vendor. At a high-level, you'll need to complete the following steps:

1. **Selecting an agreement** - Choose whether you want to use an existing agreement or establish a new agreement. The option you select in this step determines the next step in the wizard.
   * If you create a new agreement, the **Select licensee** section opens.&#x20;
   * If you use an existing agreement, the **Select items** section opens.
2. **Selecting a licensee** - Choose an existing licensee or create a new one.
3. **Providing agreement details** - Fill out the contact form.
4. **Selecting the items** - Choose the items you want to order and the quantity of those items.
5. **Adding reference details** - Add your order and agreement details as necessary.&#x20;
6. **Verifying the order** - Review the details and then click **Place order**.
7. **Reviewing the summary** - View your order summary and the latest status message.
