# How to Buy Products in the Marketplace

The Marketplace Platform is a centralized hub designed to streamline the discovery and ordering of software products.&#x20;

The platform simplifies the complex process of software licensing and procurement, making it easier for you to find and compare products from multiple software vendors in one place. Each product on our marketplace undergoes a process where vendors define the product, including its terms of use, and submit it to SoftwareOne. Products become available for ordering only after they are accepted by SoftwareOne.

The steps within the wizard vary depending on the type of product and vendor. At a high level, it contains these steps:

1. **Select agreement** - When ordering a product, you have the option to use an existing agreement or create a new one. The option you select in this step determines the next step in the wizard. For instance, when you create a new agreement, the **Select licensee** page is displayed. However, if you use an existing agreement, the **Select items** page opens.
2. **Select licensee** - You can choose an existing licensee or create a new one.&#x20;
3. **Agreement details** - Fill out the contact form.
4. **Select items** - Choose the items you want to order and the quantity of those items.
5. **Additional information**  - Add the additional IDs for the order and agreement.&#x20;
6. **Review order** - Preview the order details and place your order.
7. **Summary** - See your order summary and the latest status message.
