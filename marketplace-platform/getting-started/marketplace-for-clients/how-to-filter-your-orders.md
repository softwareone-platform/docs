# How to Filter Orders

The Marketplace Platform supports various types of orders, including change, purchase, configuration, and termination orders. All orders are displayed on the **Orders** page.&#x20;

If you need to find a specific order, you can use the filter option to search for it. There are several filter options to help you narrow down the list. You can apply a single filter or create a combination of filters by selecting different fields, operators, and values.

This topic describes how to use some of the filters.

### Filtering orders by status <a href="#using-filters-to-find-an-order" id="using-filters-to-find-an-order"></a>

To find an order using the status filter (such as **Draft**):

1. Navigate to the **Orders** page, then select the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/icon_filter.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Filter** icon.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/orders.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The filter option on the Orders page.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

2. Select **Add another condition** to open a menu of conditions.&#x20;
3. Define the conditions:
   1. In the first field, choose the property. For example, to filter your orders by their status, select **Status**.
   2. In the second field, choose the search operator. Different operators are displayed depending on the condition you selected in the first field. For this example, leave the value set to **Equal**.
   3. In the third field, type or select a value from the list of preconfigured values. The values displayed in this field are determined by your selection in the first field. To see your draft orders, select **Draft**.
   4. If needed, select **Add another condition** to specify additional conditions as needed.

### Filtering orders by order ID <a href="#using-filters-to-find-an-order" id="using-filters-to-find-an-order"></a>

To find an order using the order ID:

1. Navigate to the **Orders** page, then select the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/icon_filter.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Filter** icon.
2. Define the conditions:
   1. In the first field, select **Order ID**.
   2. In the second field, choose the search operator. For this example, leave the value set to **Contains**.
   3. In the third field, type the order number. You can enter all or part of the order's ID or name.&#x20;

### Filtering orders using a search query <a href="#using-filters-to-find-an-order" id="using-filters-to-find-an-order"></a>

The **Search query** condition allows you to enter a search term, which is then used to find matching records across other filter conditions, such as orders, agreements, and more.&#x20;

To find an order using a search query:

1. Navigate to the **Orders** page, then select the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/icon_filter.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Filter** icon.
2. Enter the desired search term.

The list of orders is refreshed automatically to display only the records that match your search criteria. To remove all filters and return to the default view, select **Reset filters** in the filter box.
