# How to Filter Your Orders

Once you've placed an order through the Marketplace Platform, it's displayed on the **Orders** page. You can access the **Orders** page from the main menu by selecting **Marketplace** > **Orders**.&#x20;

The platform supports various types of orders including change orders, purchase orders, and terminate orders, all of which are visible on the **Orders** page.

## Using filters to find an order

If you need to find a specific order, you can use the filter option to search for an order and view the order information. We provide several filter options you can use to narrow down your list of orders.&#x20;

You can use a single filter or create a combination of filters by selecting different fields, operators, and values. The following steps describe how to find an order using its status.&#x20;

1. On the **Orders** page, click the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1101).png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Filter** option.

2. When the filter box displays, click **Add another condition** to open a menu of conditions.&#x20;
3. Define the conditions:
   1. In the first field, choose the property. For example, to filter your orders by their status, select **Status**.
   2. In the second field, choose the search operator. Different operators are displayed depending on the condition you selected in the first field. For this example, leave the value set to **Equal**.
   3. In the third field, type or select a value from the list of preconfigured values. The values displayed in this field are determined by your selection in the first field. To see your draft orders, select **Draft**.
   4. If needed, click **Add another condition** to specify additional conditions as needed.

Your list of orders will be refreshed based on the filters. To reset the filters and revert to the default view, select **Reset filters** in the filter box.&#x20;

## Viewing your order's details

To view all details of an order, click the order ID in the **Order** column.&#x20;

The order details page will open, allowing you to view the basic order information, and associated items, subscriptions, ordering and fulfilment parameters, and entities.&#x20;

From the order details page, you can also complete the following tasks:

* [Add or update your order notes](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/orders/manage-order-notes.md).
* [View and download the files attached to your order](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/agreements/view-and-download-attachments.md).
