# How to Filter Your Orders

The Marketplace Platform supports various types of orders, including change, purchase, configuration, and termination orders. All orders are displayed on the **Orders** page.&#x20;

If you need to find a specific order, you can use the filter option to search for it. There are several filter options to help you narrow down the list. You can apply a single filter or create a combination of filters by selecting different fields, operators, and values. This topic describes how to use these filters.

To find an order using a filter, such as status:

1. Navigate to the **Orders** page, then select the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/icon_filter.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Filter** option.

2. Select **Add another condition** to open a menu of conditions.&#x20;
3. Define the conditions:
   1. In the first field, choose the property. For example, to filter your orders by their status, select **Status**.
   2. In the second field, choose the search operator. Different operators are displayed depending on the condition you selected in the first field. For this example, leave the value set to **Equal**.
   3. In the third field, type or select a value from the list of preconfigured values. The values displayed in this field are determined by your selection in the first field. To see your draft orders, select **Draft**.
   4. If needed, select **Add another condition** to specify additional conditions as needed.

Your list of orders is refreshed according to the filters. To reset the filters and revert to the default view, select **Reset filters** in the filter box.&#x20;

## Viewing your order's details

To view detailed information for an order, select the ID in the **Order** column. You can then view basic order information and specific order details such as items, subscriptions, and more.
