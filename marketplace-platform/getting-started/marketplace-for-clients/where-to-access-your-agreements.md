# Where to access your agreements

The **Agreements** page is where you can access all your agreements in one place.&#x20;

As agreements contain subscriptions, having access to your agreements in one place makes it easier to manage and keep track of subscriptions. Agreements also store other important documents, such as your file attachments and terms and conditions.

## Accessing your agreements <a href="#accessing-your-orders" id="accessing-your-orders"></a>

To view a list of your agreements, select the main menu of the Client Portal and then choose **Marketplace** > **Agreements**.

From here, you can view your agreement name, the product it relates to, agreement status, and more. To learn more, see [Agreements interface](../../../modules/marketplace/agreements/agreements-interface.md).

## Viewing an agreement's details <a href="#viewing-your-orders-details" id="viewing-your-orders-details"></a>

If you want to get detailed information about an agreement, click the agreement. You'll then be able to view details like the subscriptions linked to the agreement, ordering and fulfilment parameters, the buyer, seller, and licensee attached to the agreement, and more.&#x20;

From the details page, you can also easily manage your agreement. You can:

* [Terminate your agreement](https://docs.platform.softwareone.com/\~/changes/mVP8mnWO2wFE1657Z1oX/modules/marketplace/agreements/manage-your-agreements/terminate-agreements).
* [Rename your agreement](https://docs.platform.softwareone.com/\~/changes/mVP8mnWO2wFE1657Z1oX/modules/marketplace/agreements/manage-your-agreements/rename-an-agreement).
* [Edit your agreement's ID](https://docs.platform.softwareone.com/\~/changes/mVP8mnWO2wFE1657Z1oX/modules/marketplace/agreements/manage-your-agreements/edit-agreement-id).
