# How to Add Items to Your Agreement

You can add new items to your agreement using the **Buy more** option on the agreement details page.&#x20;

Items can only be added to the agreements in the active state. If the agreement is not active, the **Buy more** option will be unavailable.&#x20;

When you click **Buy more**, the platform automatically detects the agreement and takes you directly to the **Items** section of the purchase wizard, where you can select the items and complete the ordering process.
