# How to Add New Items to Your Agreement

If you want to order new items as part of your current agreement, you can use the Agreements page on the platform.&#x20;

Simply go to the details page of the agreement and select the **Buy more** option to add new items. Note that your agreement must be [active ](../../../modules/marketplace/agreements/agreement-states.md)to order new items.

   1. Click **Add items**. The **Select Items** page opens.&#x20;
   2. Choose the items you want to order. You can select one or multiple items, and use filters to narrow down the list of items.&#x20;
   3. Click **Add items** to add the new items to your order.&#x20;
   4. Adjust the new quantity as needed and then click **Next** to continue.&#x20;

A change order is created in the system and sent to the vendor for fulfilment.&#x20;

While the change order is in progress, the agreement shows as **Updating**. It means that the agreement is temporarily locked, and no further orders can be placed under this agreement until the current change order is completed.
