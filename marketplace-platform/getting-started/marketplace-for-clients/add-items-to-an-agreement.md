# How to Add Items to Your Agreement

You can add new items to your agreement using the **Buy more** option on the agreement details page.&#x20;

Items can only be added to the agreements in the active state. If the agreement is not active, the **Buy more** option will be unavailable.&#x20;

When you click **Buy more**, the platform automatically detects the agreement and takes you directly to the **Items** section of the purchase wizard, where you can select the items and complete the ordering process.

A change order is created for the agreement and sent to the vendor for fulfillment. Select **View details** to go to the order details page or select **Close** to close the wizard.

When your order has been placed, the agreement's status changes from **Active** to **Updating**. It means that the agreement is temporarily locked, and no further orders can be placed under this agreement until the current change order is completed. You can check the status of the order on the **Orders** page or within the **Orders** tab on the agreement details page.
