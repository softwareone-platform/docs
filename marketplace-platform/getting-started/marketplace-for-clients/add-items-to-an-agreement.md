# How to Add Items to Your Agreement

You can add new items to your agreement using the **Buy more** option on the agreement details page.&#x20;

Items can only be added to the agreements in the active state. If the agreement is not active, the **Buy more** option is unavailable.&#x20;

When you select **Buy more**, the platform automatically detects the agreement and takes you directly to the **Items** step of the purchase wizard, where you can choose the items you want to order and place an order.

5. In the **Details** step, add or update the reference ID and your comments. Then, select **Next**.
6. In the **Review order** step, verify the information and select **Place order**_._

A change order is created for the agreement and sent to the vendor for fulfillment. Select **View details** to go to the order details page or select **Close**.

When your order has been placed, the agreement's status changes from **Active** to **Updating**. It means that the agreement is temporarily locked, and no further orders can be placed under this agreement until the current change order is completed. You can check the status of the order on the **Orders** page or within the **Orders** tab on the agreement details page.
