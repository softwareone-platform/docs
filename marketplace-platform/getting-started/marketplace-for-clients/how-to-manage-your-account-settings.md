# How to Manage Your Account Settings

The **Settings** module gives you easy access to your account information and lets you manage the settings for your Marketplace account at any time.&#x20;

Account administrators can access the module by navigating to the main menu in the Client Portal and then selecting **Settings**.&#x20;
