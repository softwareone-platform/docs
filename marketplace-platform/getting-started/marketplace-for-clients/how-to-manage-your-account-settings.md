# How to Manage Your Account Settings

The **Settings** module gives you easy access to your account information and lets you manage the settings for your Marketplace account at any time.&#x20;

Account administrators can access the module by navigating to the main menu and selecting **Settings**.&#x20;

## Account setting options

In your account settings, you'll find various options enabling you to review your basic account details and manage your users, licensees, groups, and other properties.&#x20;
