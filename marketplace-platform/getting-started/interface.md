# Platform Interface

The Marketplace Platform is a SaaS application with three user interfaces, each catering to specific user types. These interfaces ensure that all [actors](key-concepts.md#platform-actors) can interact with the platform according to their specific requirements.&#x20;

The platform provides three distinct user interfaces namely, the Client Portal, Vendor Portal, and Operations Portal.&#x20;

* **Client Portal** - Accessed by our clients and partners for software procurement.&#x20;
* **Vendor Portal** - Used by vendors for setting up and configuring products.
* **Operations Portal** - Utilized by our internal SoftwareOne associates for administration-related activities.
