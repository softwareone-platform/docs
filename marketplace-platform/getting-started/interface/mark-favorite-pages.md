# Using Favorites

You can mark pages and accounts as favorites to access them quickly in the SoftwareOne Marketplace.

Favorite pages appear in the **Favorites** section of the main menu and on the **Home** page.

### Adding or removing a page from your favorites

To add or remove a page from your favorites:

1. In the main menu, navigate to the required page (for example, **Agreements**).
2. Hover over the page, then select the star icon ![](https://docs.platform.softwareone.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1674205915-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FZ5DNbniz33mXCZoO62Rm%252Fuploads%252FnQLwR4YVYnBE7t4oWN4a%252Ficon-star.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D2233ff5f-cd8c-41d9-ba54-7176daeeb4da\&width=40\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=59bc329d\&sv=2). The icon changes from empty to filled, indicating that the page has been added to your favorites.

3. To remove the same page from your favorites, select the same star you used to mark it as a favorite. When the icon changes from filled to empty, the page is removed from your favorites.
