# Platform Interface

The Marketplace Platform is a SaaS application with three user interfaces, each catering to specific user types. These interfaces ensure that all [actors](../key-concepts.md#platform-actors) can interact with the platform according to their specific business requirements.&#x20;

The platform provides three distinct user interfaces, namely the Client Portal, Vendor Portal, and Operations Portal.&#x20;

* **Client Portal** - Accessed by our clients and partners for software procurement.&#x20;
* **Vendor Portal** - Used by vendors for setting up and configuring products.
* **Operations Portal** - Used by internal SoftwareOne associates for administration-related activities.

## Access the interface

## Navigate the interface

The platform provides a seamless and intuitive interface, allowing access to the different modules and features within those modules. This section describes how to navigate the platform.

### Search

The Search bar lets you search for various objects in the platform, such as your orders, agreements, subscriptions, and more. You can also search for specific products and items in our catalog.

You can also use search to find user documentation. For example, you can search for "manage subscriptions" to read documentation about how to manage your subscriptions.

When performing a search, start by choosing the category you want to search across and then enter the search term. Our platform supports free text, which means you can enter all or part of the object's ID or name. For example, when searching for an agreement using its ID, select the **Agreements** category and then enter the full order ID (such as ‘AGR-8981-7039-6781’) or part of it (such as 6781). The platform will then display results matching your specified search term.

### Help icon
