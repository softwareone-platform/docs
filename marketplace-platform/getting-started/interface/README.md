# Interface Overview

The Marketplace Platform is a SaaS application with three user interfaces, each catering to specific user types. These interfaces ensure that all [actors](../key-concepts.md#platform-actors) can interact with the platform according to their specific business requirements.&#x20;

The platform provides three distinct user interfaces, namely the Client Portal, Vendor Portal, and Operations Portal.&#x20;

* **Client Portal** - Accessed by our clients and partners for software procurement.&#x20;
* **Vendor Portal** - Used by vendors for setting up and configuring products.
* **Operations Portal** - Used by internal SoftwareOne associates for administration-related activities.

## Accessing the platform

You can access the platform from an up-to-date desktop or mobile browser. For a list of supported browsers, see the [Which browsers do you support?](../../../help-and-support/faqs/which-browsers-do-you-support.md) page.

To access the platform:

1. Navigate to the sign-in page: [https://portal.platform.softwareone.com/](https://portal.platform.softwareone.com/).
2. Enter the email address associated with your account, then select **Continue**.
3. Enter your password and select **Continue**.&#x20;

When you successfully sign in, the platform's **Home** page is displayed.&#x20;

If you provide inaccurate credentials, an error message is displayed. If you can’t remember your password, select **Forgot password?** and follow the instructions to recover your password.

## Navigating the platform

The platform provides a seamless and intuitive interface, allowing access to the different modules and features within those modules. This section describes how to navigate the platform.

<summary>Using the Search feature</summary>

The Search bar enables you to search for objects, such as your orders, agreements, subscriptions, and more. You can also search for specific products and items in our catalog.

Additionally, you can use search to find documentation. For example, you can search for "manage subscriptions" to read documentation about how to manage your subscriptions.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/interface_search.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The global search bar.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

When performing a search, start by choosing the category you want to search across and then enter the search term. Our platform supports free text, which means you can enter all or part of the object's ID or name.&#x20;

For example, when searching for an agreement using its ID, select the **Agreements** category and then enter the full order ID (such as ‘AGR-8981-7039-6781’) or part of it (such as 6781). The platform will then display results matching your specified search term.
