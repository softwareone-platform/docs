# Interface Overview

The Marketplace Platform is a SoftwareOne SaaS solution that enables users to procure and manage software solutions. This page provides a high-level overview of the platform interface and explains how to navigate and use its core features.

This content applies to all Marketplace Platform users, including Client Portal users (clients and partners), Vendor Portal users (software vendors), and Operations Portal users (SoftwareOne internal associates).

## Signing in to your account

You can access the platform from an up-to-date desktop or mobile browser. For a list of supported browsers, see [Which browsers do you support?](../../../help-and-support/faqs/which-browsers-do-you-support.md).

To sign in to your SoftwareOne Marketplace account:

2. Enter the email address associated with your account, then select **Continue**.

Upon successful sign-in, the **Home** page of the platform is displayed.

If you provide inaccurate credentials, an error message is displayed. If you don’t remember your password, select **Forgot password?** and follow the instructions to recover it.

## Understanding the interface layout

The Marketplace Platform interface is designed to provide consistent navigation across all portals.

While the layout is consistent, the available modules and content depend on your role and portal (Client, Vendor, or Operations).

### Header

The header is always visible and contains the following components:

<details>

<summary>Main navigation menu</summary>

The main navigation menu provides access to the modules that are enabled for your account. Select <img src="https://docs.platform.softwareone.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.gitbook.com%2Fcontent%2FZ5DNbniz33mXCZoO62Rm%2Fblobs%2FOLjL8UWGYaC92htkTh07%2Fmenu_24dp_5F6368_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.png&#x26;width=40&#x26;dpr=4&#x26;quality=100&#x26;sign=94fc8f43&#x26;sv=2" alt="" data-size="line"> **Home** in the header to open the menu.

When you are viewing a page within a specific module, the menu label changes to match that context (for example, it displays **Billing** when viewing invoices, **Marketplace** when viewing subscriptions, and so on).

<summary>Global search</summary>

The **Search** bar in the header enables you to search for objects, such as your orders, agreements, subscriptions, and more. You can also search for specific products and items in our catalog.

Additionally, you can use search to access product documentation, including resources such as tutorials, FAQs, and procedures. For example, you can search for 'manage subscriptions' to read documentation about how to manage your subscriptions.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/interface_search.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The global search bar.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

When performing a search, start by choosing the category you want to search across and then enter the search term. Our platform supports free text, which means you can enter all or part of the object's ID or name.&#x20;

For example, when searching for an agreement using its ID, select the **Agreements** category and then enter the full order ID (such as ‘AGR-8981-7039-6781’) or part of it (such as 6781). The platform will then display results matching your specified search term.
