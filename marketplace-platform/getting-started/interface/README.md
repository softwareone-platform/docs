# Platform Interface

The Marketplace Platform is a SaaS application with three user interfaces, each catering to specific user types. These interfaces ensure that all [actors](../key-concepts.md#platform-actors) can interact with the platform according to their specific requirements.&#x20;

The platform provides three distinct user interfaces, namely the Client Portal, Vendor Portal, and Operations Portal.&#x20;

* **Client Portal** - Accessed by our clients and partners for software procurement.&#x20;
* **Vendor Portal** - Used by vendors for setting up and configuring products.
* **Operations Portal** - Used by internal SoftwareOne associates for administration-related activities.

## Access the interface

You can access the platform from an up-to-date desktop or mobile browser. For a list of supported browsers, see [Which browsers do you support?](../../../help-and-support/faqs/which-browsers-do-you-support.md).

If you can’t remember your password, select the **Forgot password?** link on the **Sign-in** page and then follow the instructions. For more information, see [Update password](../../../help-and-support/faqs/update-password.md).

## Navigate the interface

The platform provides a seamless and intuitive interface, allowing access to the different modules and features within those modules. This section describes how to navigate the platform.

### Main navigation menu

The <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/icon_menu.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Home** menu in the top left is where you can access the modules enabled for your account.&#x20;

### Search

The Search bar lets you search for various objects in the platform, such as your orders, agreements, subscriptions, and more. You can also search for specific products and items in our catalog.

When performing a search, start by choosing the category you want to search across and then enter the search term. Our platform supports free text, which means you can enter all or part of the object's ID or name. For example, when searching for an agreement using its ID, select the **Agreements** category and then enter the full order ID (such as ‘AGR-8981-7039-6781’) or part of it (such as 6781). The platform will then display results matching your specified search term.

You can also use search to find user documentation. For example, you can search for "manage subscriptions" to read documentation about how to manage your subscriptions.

### Help icon

The Help icon <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/icon_help.png" alt="" data-size="line"> contains links to various content resources, such as the [SoftwareOne blog](https://www.softwareone.com/en/blog/articles), product documentation, [news and updates](https://www.softwareone.com/en/media-releases), and our legal pages. You can also [Contact Marketplace Platform Support](../../../help-and-support/contact-support.md) by selecting **Support**.
