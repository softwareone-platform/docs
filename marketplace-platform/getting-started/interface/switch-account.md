# Switch Accounts

The Marketplace Platform allows an individual to be linked to several accounts and switch between those accounts, without signing out of the platform. Switching can be done through your profile menu.

{% hint style="info" %}
The option to switch accounts is only available for members of multiple accounts.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to switch between your accounts:

1. Sign in to your account and click your profile menu in the upper right. All accounts that you belong to are displayed under **Switch account**.

2. Select the account you want to switch to. If you belong to several accounts, use the **Search** field to find the required account easily. You can search by the account name or its identifier.

Your account will be switched and you'll be able to access the platform modules and settings linked to your profile.&#x20;
