# Switch between your accounts

The Marketplace Platform allows an individual to be linked to several accounts.&#x20;

If you belong to multiple accounts, you can conveniently switch between those accounts without signing out of the platform. Switching can be done through your user profile menu.

{% hint style="info" %}
The option to switch accounts is only available for members of multiple accounts.
{% endhint %}

**To switch between your accounts:**

1. Sign in to your account and click your profile menu in the upper right. All accounts that you belong to are displayed under **Switch account**.

2. Select the account you want to switch to. If there are several accounts, use the **Search** field to find the required account easily. You can search by the account name or its marketplace identifier.

After selecting the account, your account will be switched and you'll be able to access the settings and modules linked to your profile.&#x20;
