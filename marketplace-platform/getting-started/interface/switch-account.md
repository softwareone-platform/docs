# Switch between your accounts

The Marketplace Platform allows an individual to be linked to several accounts.&#x20;

If you belong to multiple accounts, you can conveniently switch between those accounts without signing out of the platform. Switching can be done through your user profile menu.

{% hint style="info" %}
The option to switch accounts is only available for members of multiple accounts.
{% endhint %}

**To switch between your accounts:**

1. Sign in to your account and then click your profile menu in the upper right. Your associated accounts are displayed under **Switch account**.
2. Select the account you want to switch to. If you are linked to several accounts, use the **Search** field to find the account easily.&#x20;
