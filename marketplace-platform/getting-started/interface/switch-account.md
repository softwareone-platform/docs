# Switch Accounts

The Marketplace Platform allows an individual to be linked to several accounts and switch between those accounts without signing out of the platform. Switching can be done through your profile menu.

## Switching accounts

To switch between your accounts:

1. Sign in to your account and select your profile menu in the upper right. All accounts you are a member of are displayed under **Switch account**.

2. Select the account you want to switch to. Use the **Search** field to find the required account easily. You can search by the account name or its identifier.

Your account is switched, giving you access to the modules and settings linked to your profile.&#x20;
