# View Pending Tasks

The **Spotlight** widget in the Marketplace Platform is designed to draw your attention to the key objects in the platform, including your agreements, orders, subscriptions, and more. For example, if you have subscriptions that are nearing expiration, those subscriptions are spotlighted so you can access and manage them easily.

You can find the widget on the **Home** page, and it can also be accessed by clicking the Pending Actions icon <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/icon_pending_actions.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the status bar.

In the **Spotlight** widget, the information is grouped according to the object type; for example, subscriptions requiring attention are displayed under **Subscriptions**. Similarly, orders that may be querying for additional information are shown under **Orders**, and so on.&#x20;

By default, five items are displayed within each group, but you can click **view all** to navigate to the object's main page.

The widget also displays a total count of items requiring attention, so you always know how many items are outstanding within each group. The details are synced periodically to ensure you stay informed and always have the latest information. If required, you can refresh the list manually by clicking the Sync icon <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/icon_sync.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the widget.
