# View Pending Tasks

The **Pending tasks** widget in the Marketplace Platform provides a unified view of all tasks that need your attention. It allows you to quickly view and manage pending tasks for key platform objects, such as your orders, agreements, subscriptions, invoices, and more.&#x20;

You can find the widget on the **Home** page, and it can also be accessed by clicking the Pending Actions icon <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/pending_actions_24dp_434343_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the status bar.

In **Pending tasks**, all tasks are grouped by object; for example, pending tasks associated with your agreements are grouped and displayed under **Agreements**. Similarly, tasks related to requests you may have created are displayed under **Requests**. You can easily expand a group to view all tasks it contains.&#x20;

The widget also displays the total number of pending tasks, so you always know how many tasks are outstanding. The count and the list of tasks are synced periodically to ensure you stay informed and always have the latest information. You can also refresh the list manually by clicking the Sync icon <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/sync_24dp_434343_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.png" alt="" data-size="line">.

When you click a specific task, the details page opens, where you can take appropriate action. Clicking **View all** displays all outstanding tasks in the list.&#x20;
