# Manage Notification Preferences

The Marketplace Platform sends notification emails based on specific events in your account. These alerts are triggered according to the notification categories enabled for your profile.&#x20;

If you want to opt out of these alerts, you can update your preferences. There are two ways to do this:&#x20;

* By signing in to your account and using the **My profile** option.
* By selecting the **Manage notifications** link in the footer of your notification email. This option allows you to update preferences without signing in to the platform.

### Managing notifications (using the **My profile** option)

{% hint style="info" %}
* Some categories are enabled by default, and you can't opt out of these categories.&#x20;
* Admins can manage preferences at the account level through the [Notifications ](../../../modules-and-features/settings/notifications/)option in the **Settings** menu.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To update your preferences using the **My profile** option:
