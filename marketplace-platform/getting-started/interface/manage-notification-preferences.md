# Manage Notification Preferences

The Marketplace Platform sends notification emails when a specific event occurs, for instance, when a new order is placed or if your agreement has been terminated.&#x20;

These emails are sent depending on the notification category and recipients set up to receive these notifications.&#x20;

The list of recipients is configured by your account administrator. However, the platform gives you the flexibility to define your preferences and enable or disable emails. &#x20;

There are two ways to manage notifications. You can either manage them by signing in to your account and updating the settings or using the **Manage notifications** link in the footer of the email you received.&#x20;
