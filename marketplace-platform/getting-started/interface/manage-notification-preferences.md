# Manage Notification Preferences

The Marketplace Platform sends notification emails when a specific event occurs, such as when someone places a new order in your account.&#x20;

These emails are sent based on the [notification categories](../../../modules-and-features/settings/notifications/#notification_types) enabled for your account and the recipients set up by your account administrator. If you received a notification email, it means you are either part of the group set up to receive these emails or your administrator selected you individually.&#x20;

However, you have the flexibility to update your notifications preferences. There are two ways to manage your preferences:&#x20;

* By signing in to your account and using the **My profile** option.
* By selecting the **Manage notifications** link in the footer of your notification email.&#x20;
