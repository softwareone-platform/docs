# Manage Notification Preferences

The Marketplace Platform sends notification emails for specific events in your account.

These alerts are triggered for the [notification categories](../../../modules-and-features/settings/notifications/#notification_types) enabled for your account. If you want to opt out of these alerts, you can update your preferences. There are two ways to do this:&#x20;

* By signing in to your account and using the **My profile** option.
* By selecting the **Manage notifications** link in the footer of your notification email. This method doesn't require signing in to your account.

## Managing your notification preferences
