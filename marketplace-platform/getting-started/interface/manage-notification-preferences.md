# Manage Notification Preferences

The Marketplace Platform sends notification emails for specific events in your account.

These alerts are triggered for the [notification categories](../../../modules-and-features/settings/notifications/#notification_types) enabled for your account and are sent to the recipients defined by the account administrator. If you want to opt out of these alerts, you can update your preferences. There are two ways to do this:&#x20;

* By signing in to your account and using the **My profile** option.
* By selecting the **Manage notifications** link in the footer of your notification email.&#x20;
