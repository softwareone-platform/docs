# Manage Notification Preferences

The Marketplace Platform sends notification emails based on specific events in your account. These alerts are triggered according to the notification categories enabled for your profile.&#x20;

If you want to opt out of these alerts, you can update your preferences. There are two ways to do this:&#x20;

* By signing in to your account and using the **My profile** option.
* By selecting the **Manage notifications** link in the footer of your notification email. This option allows you to update preferences without signing in to the platform.
