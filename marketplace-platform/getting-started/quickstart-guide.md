### Make your first purchase

When you’re ready to make your first purchase, browse the catalog to view the available products, then place your order.

<details>

<summary>Find the desired product</summary>

There are two primary ways of finding products in the Marketplace.

* [Visit the Products page](../../modules-and-features/catalog/products.md).

</details>

<details>
