# What's new in v1

We’re excited to announce that we’ve rebranded PyraCloud to SoftwareOne Client Portal to align it with our global brand identity.

We’ve used our learnings and feedback from our clients to improve usability and enhance the look and feel of our platform.

Our new Client Portal v1 includes the following changes:

***

### **Rebranding**

As part of our branding updates, we’ve modified the **Login** page, header and footer, and in-app pages.&#x20;

The branding updates include changes to our logo, colors, fonts, and icons. These changes are made to provide you with a unified SoftwareOne brand experience.

***

### **New Home page**

We’ve redesigned the Home page to provide you quick access to different modules, platform news, and updates. The list of modules is displayed based on your access permissions.&#x20;

On the **Home** page, you can also view your account information, favorites, and a list of your recently viewed pages. For more information, see [Understanding the Home page](../).

### **Navigation menu**

Our new navigation menu simplifies the experience by allowing you to easily discover and launch a module. We’ve also reorganized the menu options and added descriptions to help provide more context.&#x20;

Other changes include:

* The **Favorites** and **Recently viewed** quick links are added to the navigation menu for easy access.
* The **Buy** module is renamed to **Marketplace** to make it more relevant.
* A new **Help** module has been added. This module contains links to our online documentation, support resources, and platform updates.

### **Product documentation**

We’ve made the following updates to our product documentation:

* Aligned the content with our rebranding and the user interface changes.
* Removed the outdated product videos and screenshots.
* Made editorial updates to enhance content clarity and readability.

We hope these updates will make your experience intuitive, seamless, and efficient.
