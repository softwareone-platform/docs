# Transfer Your Adobe Reseller

Adobe allows its VIP Marketplace customers to switch from their current reseller to a new one. This process is called reseller transfer.&#x20;

If you are currently buying Adobe product licenses through a non-SoftwareOne reseller, you can transfer your account to SoftwareOne.&#x20;

When the transfer process completes, SoftwareOne will become your new reseller, managing your Adobe subscriptions and orders.

{% hint style="info" %}
* Reseller transfers are allowed only for the Adobe VIP Marketplace. Licensing programs such as the Value Incentive Plan (VIP), Cumulative Licensing Program (CLP), Transactional Licensing Program (TLP), and Enterprise Term Licensing Agreement (ETLA) don't permit a change of reseller.
* The Marketplace Platform supports reseller transfers for all supported Adobe VIP Marketplace products, including Commercial, Education, and Government.
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites

Before starting the reseller change process, make sure you have the following details from your Adobe Admin Console:

## Performing the reseller transfer

You can perform a reseller transfer by creating a new agreement via the Marketplace Platform. All reseller transfers require a new agreement and a new purchase order.&#x20;

To initiate the transfer process:&#x20;

1. Sign in to the Marketplace Platform.
2. Navigate to the **Products** page. Then, select the desired Adobe product, for example, **Adobe VIP Marketplace for Commercial**.
3. On the product details page, select **Buy now**.
4. In the purchase wizard, complete the following steps:
   1. Select **Create agreement**.&#x20;
   2. Choose an existing licensee from the list or [create a new one](../../modules-and-features/settings/licensees/create-licensees.md). Then, select **Next**.
   3.  Choose **Transfer account** and select **Next**.&#x20;

   4.  Provide your system administrator's email address and the approval code from the Admin Console. Make sure that the approval code is valid. If the code has expired, you must generate a new one from the Admin Console. Select **Next** to continue.

   7. Read the terms and conditions and the privacy statement. When done, select **Place order** to submit your order.
