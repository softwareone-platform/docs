# Adobe VIP Marketplace

VIP Marketplace enables resellers to resell Adobe licenses that meet their customers’ needs directly on their online marketplaces. It was designed to provide streamlined automated purchasing, provisioning, and billing. A variety of term-length options, volume discounts, and product offerings help VIP Marketplace members—customer organizations of all sizes—meet their unique needs by purchasing as many licenses as they need in one flexible transaction.

VIP Marketplace allows your reseller to purchase the Adobe licenses your team needs directly from a partner online ordering experience. They can purchase as many or as few licenses as you need in one simple transaction with the flexibility to add more as your organization grows.

## How to get started with VIP Marketplace <a href="#howtogetstarted" id="howtogetstarted"></a>

After you place an order with your reseller, you will receive an invitation to accept the terms and conditions for VIP Marketplace. Once you’ve accepted the terms and conditions, you’ll have the ability to manage your licenses and begin deploying them to users immediately in the [Adobe Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html).

If you are currently a member of the Value Incentive Plan, you can move seamlessly to VIP Marketplace to benefit from features like automatic renewal. Please talk to your Adobe reseller for more details on moving to VIP Marketplace.

## VIP ID: Your organization’s account ID <a href="#vipidyourorganizationsaccountid" id="vipidyourorganizationsaccountid"></a>

Your VIP ID is a unique number that identifies your organization as a member of VIP Marketplace. Keep track of this number so you can provide it to your reseller when placing orders or asking questions about your account. This number is confidential information for your organization and will remain effective till you're a VIP Marketplace Member.

## Managing licenses <a href="#managinglicenses" id="managinglicenses"></a>

The Admin Console is an online tool that allows organizations to manage their users as well as the addition, assignment, and reassignment of Adobe licenses. The member of your organization who received the welcome email and accepted the VIP Marketplace terms and conditions is the first person who will have access to your organization’s Admin Console. Once this person accesses the Admin Console, they can begin managing licenses and users along with granting administration rights to other members of their organization.

### Adding licenses <a href="#addinglicenses" id="addinglicenses"></a>

Adding licenses is simple in the Admin Console. Once you’ve added the additional licenses your team needs, you may provide your users with immediate access. Your reseller will be notified that you’ve made a request to place an order. You must place an order with your reseller within 7 days or Adobe will automatically remove the licenses.

## Volume discounts <a href="#volume-discounts" id="volume-discounts"></a>

You can save more as a VIP Marketplace Member when your organization qualifies for volume discounts. Purchase 10 or more licenses during a subscription term to qualify. Your discount increases as you purchase more licenses. Follow the charts below to know more:\


![Displays volume volume discount pyramid against number of licenses](https://helpx-prod.scene7.com/is/image/HelpxProd/vip-pyramid-marketplace?$png$\&jpegSize=200\&wid=1048)![Table displays various discount levels according to your license quantity](https://helpx-prod.scene7.com/is/image/HelpxProd/dicsount-levels?$png$\&jpegSize=100\&wid=330)

### Qualify for volume discounts with a single purchase

As a VIP Member with fewer than 10 licenses, you can automatically qualify for volume discounts with a single order of 10 or more licenses. Place an order for the minimum license quantity for your preferred discount level, and your membership will automatically receive the respective volume discount.

### Qualify for volume discount at renewal

You can qualify for volume discounts with your renewal order. Your volume discount is automatically calculated based on the licenses renewed in your auto-renewal order.

If your renewal total is 10 licenses or more, then that renewal order and subsequent orders of any size qualify for the volume discount earned at renewal. You can add more licenses to achieve the 50- and 100-license thresholds for higher discounts.

## Important dates <a href="#importantdates" id="importantdates"></a>

### Account anniversary date <a href="#accountanniversarydate" id="accountanniversarydate"></a>

Your VIP Anniversary Date is set to be 12 months from the date of your initial order.

### Daily proration <a href="#dailyproration" id="dailyproration"></a>

Additional licenses may be added at any time after your initial order. The anniversary date for your additional licenses will be listed on the order confirmation email and in the Account tab in the Admin Console. Add-on licenses are prorated for the length of time they will be used until your next Anniversary Date. Your licenses will be renewed on the Anniversary Date, and changes to your Adobe subscriptions must be made before this date.

### Renewal <a href="#marketplace-renewal" id="marketplace-renewal"></a>

Licenses purchased through VIP Marketplace automatically renew for the following year. Your annual subscription will automatically renew with Adobe on your Anniversary Date at the partner price in effect for your qualifying discount level (prices subject to change), unless your Account Manager cancels with Adobe at least 3 days before your Anniversary Date. See your Account Manager for their applicable cancellation period, which may be longer than 3 days. If you purchase via a reseller, then your reseller is your Account Manager.

If you opt-out of automatic renewal, your licenses will be deactivated at your next Anniversary Date. A reminder notification will be sent before any licenses are deactivated, and you may update your renewal settings by contacting your reseller before the Anniversary Date. For clarity, your Account Manager will determine your Product fees.

For example, if in your current term you are at discount level 2 (10-49 licenses) and in your renewal term your auto-renewal order is for 50-99 licenses, you would receive the level 3 discount level. Also, if in your current term your Adobe product offer is based on promotional pricing, then in your renewal term, your Adobe product offer will be based on standard pricing because the promotional pricing expired.

### Returns <a href="#returns" id="returns"></a>

Returns are accepted if the entire order is returned and if the licenses are not currently in use. You must make the return request with your reseller within 14 days of placing the order.

#### RETURNS FOR CUSTOMERS MIGRATING FROM VIP TO VIP MARKETPLACE

If the VIP Member has any VIP orders that are eligible for return, then such orders may no longer be returned after migration to the VIP Marketplace.  Upon migration to VIP Marketplace, VIP Member waives any rights to return for such orders.

## Cancellation

Once you are enrolled in VIP Marketplace, your membership remains effective until any of the following conditions occur:

* You choose to leave the program by giving a 30-day notice of cancellation to your reseller
* Adobe terminates the program
* Your membership is terminated due to a breach of program terms and conditions

The program terms and conditions are subject to change at any time. You will be presented with updated terms and conditions the next time you log in if there are any changes.

### Regional deployment <a href="#regionaldeployment" id="regionaldeployment"></a>

VIP Members must purchase for the country where their team members reside. For team members residing in Europe, “country” shall mean Europe. In this case, “Europe” means EU Member countries Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK. To the extent there is inconsistency between this restriction and terms stated in an applicable end-user license agreement, this restriction shall govern.
