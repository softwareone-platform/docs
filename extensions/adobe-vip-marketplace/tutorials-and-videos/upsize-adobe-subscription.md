# Upsize Adobe Subscription

If you need to increase the licenses for your Adobe subscription, you can place a change order through the Marketplace Platform.&#x20;

There are two ways to increase the number of licenses. The first is by increasing the quantity directly within the subscription, and the second is through the Purchase wizard.&#x20;

This tutorial shows how to order additional licenses by editing the subscription. You can watch the following video or continue reading for the step-by-step instructions.&#x20;
