# Upsize Adobe Subscription

If you need to increase the number of licenses for your Adobe subscription, you can place a change order through the Marketplace Platform.

2. Through the Purchase Wizard.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to increase licenses using the first method. Watch the video below or continue reading for step-by-step instructions.
