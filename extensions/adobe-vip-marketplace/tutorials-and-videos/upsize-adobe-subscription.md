# Upsize Adobe Subscription

If you need to increase the number of licenses for your Adobe subscription, you can place a change order through the Marketplace Platform.

There are two ways to add additional licenses:

2. Through the Purchase Wizard.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to increase licenses using the first method. Watch the video below or continue reading for step-by-step instructions.
