# Upsize Adobe Subscription

This tutorial describes how you can increase the number of licenses for your Adobe subscription by submitting a change order.

The Marketplace Platform provides three ways to order additional licenses:

1. Using the **Buy More** option on the **Agreements** page. This method requires you to go to the **Products** page, select the required Adobe product, and follow the purchase wizard.
2. Through the **Buy More** option on the details page of the agreement containing the subscription.
3. By editing the subscription and increasing the license quantity within that subscription.

This tutorial focuses on option 3, which involves editing the subscription directly.

2. **Details** - Enter the reference information that might help you identify the change order easily. You can add the **Additional ID** and **Notes**. When done, select **Next**.
3. **Review order** - Read the terms and conditions of the order and the privacy statement. When done, select **Place order** to submit your order.
4. **Summary** - Select **View details** to go to the order details page. Otherwise, select **Close** to exit the wizard.

## Next steps

Once your order is submitted for processing, the status of your subscription and the associated agreement changes from **Active** to **Updating**.

While the order is being updated, you cannot make any further changes until the change order is processed. You can view the most up-to-date information on your order and its status on the [Order details](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/orders/#subscription-details) page.
