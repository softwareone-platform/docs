# Downsize Adobe Subscription

This tutorial describes how you can lower the quantity of your Adobe licenses by submitting a change order through the Marketplace Platform.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Adobe offers a 14-day return window. If you decrease the number of licenses within 14 days, SoftwareOne will action your request and update your subscription.

If you are outside the return period, the decrease will only take effect on your renewal date.
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure that the subscription you want to downsize is in the active state. A subscription in any other state cannot be downsized.&#x20;

## Downsizing a subscription

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Open the subscription you want to downsize**

To open the subscription:

1. Navigate to the **Subscriptions** page.
2. Select the desired subscription.
3. On the subscription details page, select **Edit** to start the **Edit subscription** wizard.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Decrease the quantity**

&#x20;In the **Edit subscription** wizard, complete the following steps:

1. **Items** - Under **New qty,** enter the new item quantity. In the following image, the quantity of both items is changed from **20** to **19**.

2. **Details** - Enter the reference information that might help you identify the change order easily. You can add the **Additional ID** and **Notes**. When done, select **Next**.
3. **Review order** - Read the terms and conditions of the order and the privacy statement. When done, select **Place order** to submit your order.
4. **Summary** - Select **View details** to go to the order details page. Otherwise, select **Close** to exit the wizard.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Next steps

Once your order is submitted for processing, the status of your subscription and the agreement changes from **Active** to **Updating**. While the order is being updated, you won't be able to make any further changes until your order has been processed.

You can view the most up-to-date information on your order and its status on the [Order details](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/orders/#subscription-details) page.
