# Downsize Adobe Subscription

If you want to lower the quantity of your Adobe licenses, you can place a change order through the Marketplace Platform. This tutorial shows how you can decrease the quantity.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Adobe offers a 14-day return window. If you decrease the number of licenses within 14 days, SoftwareOne will action your request and update your subscription.&#x20;

If you are outside the return period, the decrease will only take effect on your renewal date.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
