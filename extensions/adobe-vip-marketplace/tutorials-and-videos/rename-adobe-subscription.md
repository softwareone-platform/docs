# Rename Adobe Subscription

Your account on the Marketplace Platform may have several Adobe subscriptions. You can rename these subscriptions so you can identify them easily.&#x20;

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to rename a subscription from _Creative Cloud All Apps Pro for Enterprise_ to _Creative Cloud test._

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure that the subscription you want to rename is in the **Active** or **Updating** state. Terminated subscriptions cannot be renamed.

## 1. Open the subscription <a href="#section-viewing-subscriptions" id="section-viewing-subscriptions"></a>

1. On the **Subscriptions** page (**Marketplace** > **Subscriptions**), click the subscription you want to rename.&#x20;
