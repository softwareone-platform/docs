# Order Adobe Subscription

Buying from the Adobe VIP Marketplace buying program means purchasing subscription-based products. You subscribe to these products and pay periodically for their usage.&#x20;

To order a subscription, you must have an agreement. An agreement is a contractual relationship between a seller, a buyer, and a licensee. Therefore, each ordered subscription is part of an agreement.&#x20;

When you place an order, you either set up a new agreement or add to an existing agreement. This tutorial shows how to order an Adobe subscription by setting up a new agreement and a new Adobe VIP Marketplace account.&#x20;

Watch the following video or continue reading for the step-by-step instructions.&#x20;
