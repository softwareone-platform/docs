# Common error messages

This topic describes some error messages you might encounter when adjusting the quantity of your Adobe licenses.

**Error Message** - "Cannot reduce the quantity by {delta}. Please reduce the quantity by {x}, {y}, or wait until the return window expires."

**Cause** - This error can occur for several reasons. Primarily, it happens when the platform doesn't recognize the requested change to the license quantity. For instance, if you ordered 15 licenses of Photoshop for Teams, but want to downsize to 10 within the 14-day return period.

**Resolution** - To resolve this issue, adjust the quantity of your licenses to match the valid quantity for the returnable orders or wait until the return window closes to modify your renewal quantity. To learn more, see [Downsize and termination policies](downsize-and-termination-policies.md).

***

**Error Message** - "Cannot reduce the quantity to zero. Consider placing a termination order instead."

**Cause** - This error occurs when lowering the quantity of licenses would result in zero licenses.

**Resolution** - To resolve this issue, you must terminate the subscription completely by placing a termination order. For termination steps, see [Terminate Adobe Subscription](tutorials-and-videos/terminate-adobe-subscription.md).
