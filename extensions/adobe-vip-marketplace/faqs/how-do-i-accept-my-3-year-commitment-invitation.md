# How do I accept my 3-year commitment invitation?

When SoftwareOne issues your 3-year commitment invitation, you will receive an email from Adobe. The email contains information about the 3-year commit program.&#x20;

Your Adobe Admin Console administrator must review the details, including terms and conditions, and confirm the acceptance.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you didn't receive the email or have trouble accessing it, you can still complete the acceptance process directly in the Adobe Admin Console. In such cases, skip to step 3 in the following procedure.
{% endhint %}

**To accept the invitation**

1. Open the 3-year commit email from Adobe, which is usually sent from message@adobe.com.
2. Select **Review offer**. You'll be directed to the Adobe Admin Console.

4. On the **Accept 3 Year Commit** page:

After you have accepted the invitation, we'll update your 3-year commit details in the Marketplace platform. The product prices will then be adjusted according to your qualified discount level.
