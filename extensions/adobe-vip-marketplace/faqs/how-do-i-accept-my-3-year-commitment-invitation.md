# How do I accept my 3-year commitment invitation

When SoftwareOne sends you an invitation for your 3-year commitment (3YC), you will receive an email from Adobe as well as a notification in your Adobe Admin Console.&#x20;

This invitation includes information about the 3YC program.

### Invitation eligibility

To receive and accept the invitation, you must have access to the Adobe Admin Console. Additionally:

* You must be an active administrator. If you are not an active administrator when the 3YC invitation is sent, you will not receive it.
* If there are multiple administrators in the Adobe Admin Console, all of them will receive the invitation and can take action on it.&#x20;
* 3YC invitations are sent to administrators based on their roles. Therefore, it is not possible to include or exclude specific individuals from receiving the invitation.

### Accepting the invitation

Accepting the invitation involves reviewing the program details, including terms and conditions, and confirming the acceptance.&#x20;

If you didn't receive the invitation email or have trouble accessing it, you can still complete the acceptance process directly in the Adobe Admin Console. In such cases, skip to step 3 in the following procedure.
