# What happens if I terminate or downsize my subscription?

You can downsize or terminate Adobe subscriptions through the Marketplace Platform. Subscriptions can be managed both inside and outside the 14-day return window, although different rules apply depending on the return period.

For detailed information on how downsizes and terminations work for Adobe subscriptions, see [Termination and downsize policies](../downsize-and-termination-policies.md).
