# What happens if I terminate my Adobe subscription?

Adobe subscriptions can be terminated both within and outside the 14-day return period.&#x20;

**Within the 14-day return period**

If you terminate a subscription within the 14-day return period (from the date your order is placed):

* In the Marketplace Platform, the items within the subscription will show the quantity as zero and the subscription will move to a **Terminated** status with auto-renewal disabled. In the Adobe Admin Console, you'll see that your subscriptions have been removed.
* If you order a subscription and terminate it in the same month, there's no charge.
* If you order a subscription and terminate it the next month within the 14-day return period, you'll be charged for the order at the end of the first month and receive a credit of the same amount at the end of the following month. For example, if you order a subscription on the June 28 and then terminate it on July 4, you'll charged for the order in July and then credited the same amount in August.

**Outside the 14-day return period**

If you terminate a subscription outside the 14-day return period:

* In the Marketplace Platform, the items in the subscription will show zero quantity and the subscription will move to a **Terminated** status with auto-renewal disabled. In the Adobe Admin Console, you'll see an active subscription that terminates on the renewal date.
* There's no refund for the terminated subscriptions.
