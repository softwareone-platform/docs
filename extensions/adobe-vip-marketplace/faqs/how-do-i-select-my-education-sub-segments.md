# How do I select my education sub-segments

When setting up a new Education-segment account or when placing orders against an existing one, customers must choose their Education sub-segments in the Adobe Admin Console. This task only needs to be completed once.

{% hint style="info" %}
These steps must be completed by an Adobe Admin Console administrator.
{% endhint %}

**To select your sub-segment(s)**

1. Sign in to the Adobe Admin Console
2. On the **Required action: Confirm type of organization** page:
   1. Select the sub-segment(s) applicable to your organization.
   2. Select **Confirm and continue**.

3. If you have an Order in the SoftwareOne Marketplace that is in "Querying" status for this account, open the order and click **Process**.

**Selection rules**

Adobe enforces a mutually exclusive relationship between the sub-segment groups:

* Customers may select **K-12**, **Higher Education**, or **both**.
* Customers may select **Non-Profit**, but **not** in combination with K-12 or Higher Education.
