# How do I select my education sub-segments?

When setting up a new education-segment account or when placing orders against an existing one, you must choose your Education sub-segments in the Adobe Admin Console. This task only needs to be completed once.&#x20;

Adobe enforces a mutually exclusive relationship between the sub-segment groups:

* You can select **K-12**, **Higher Education**, or **both**.
* You can select **Non-Profit**, but not in combination with K-12 or Higher Education.

### Selecting your education sub-segments

To select your sub-segments:

2. On the **Required action: Confirm type of organization** page:
   1. Select the sub-segments applicable to your organization.
   2. Select **Confirm and continue**.

3. If you have an order with a **Querying** status in the Marketplace, open the order, then select **Process**. For instructions, see [Set Querying Orders to Processing](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/orders/set-an-order-to-processing.md).
