# What happens when I reduce the quantity my Adobe subscription?

Adobe subscriptions can be upsized and downsized both within and outside the 14-day return period.&#x20;

## Reducing the quantity of a subscription

If you choose to downsize your subscriptions you can expect the following:

**Inside the return window**:

1. The SoftwareOne Marketplace will return the items recently purchased and the quantity will decrease in the Marketplace and the Adobe Admin Console.

**Outside the return window:**

1. The SoftwareOne Marketplace sets the renewal quantity at Adobe to the desired quantity.
2. You will see the original quantity in the Admin Console until your renewal anniversary date.
3. The SoftwareOne Marketplace shows the renewal quantity as the current quantity in SWO Marketplace.

The upshot is you will see a higher quantity in the Admin Console vs what you see in the SWO Marketplace.

&#x20;

**Upsizing after a downsize**

&#x20;If you upsize after a downsize then the new quantity will be the renewal quantity + the upsize count. This may be confusing because (for example):

1. Say you have 20 licenses (purchased outside the return window). They reduce by 5 licenses.
   1. The Adobe Admin Console still shows 20 licenses until the renewal anniversary date (which will then show 15).
   2. The SWO Marketplace shows 15 licenses.
2. You then add 10 more licenses
   1. The Adobe Admin Console shows 25 licenses (15 @renewal + 10) **<- this is confusing to the customer because currently you have 20 + 10 = 30.**
   2. The SWO Marketplace shows 25 licenses.
