6.5   Customer may add additional Units to its Adobe Product Subscriptions via Adobe’s admin console (“**Admin Console**”) and should then be able to use the additional Units added.

### Returns

Customer must follow the procedure for this on the SoftwareOne Marketplace or call or email its SoftwareOne Account Manager. No extended return periods will apply, and no returns will be accepted after that ten (10) day window has lapsed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Adobe Product will not be accepted as a return if any portion of such Adobe Product has been used.

6.8   In order to return an order, an entire order must be returned. No partial returns are permitted.

6.9   If Customer has migrated from VIP to Adobe VIP Marketplace, Customer acknowledges and agrees that VIP orders cannot be returned within VIP Marketplace. After migration to VIP Marketplace, any orders placed in VIP may no longer be returned. Even if such prior VIP orders would have been eligible for return in VIP, such orders may no longer be returned once  Customer has migrated to VIP Marketplace. Upon migration to VIP Marketplace, Customer waives any rights to return such orders.
