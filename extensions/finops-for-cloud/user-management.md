# User Management

The **Users** page in FinOps for Cloud lets you view the current members in your account and invite new ones to join your organization. You can access this page from the sidebar.&#x20;

From this page, you can also remove a member from your account.

## Sending an email invite

Follow these steps to invite new members to your organization:&#x20;

1. On the **Users** page, click **Invite**. The **Invite users** page opens.
2. Enter the details as required:
   1. **Email** - Enter the email addresses of all members you wish to invite. You can invite multiple members at once.
   2. **Role** - Select all the roles you want to assign to the new members. The following options are available:
      * **Organization manager** -&#x20;
      * **Manager** -&#x20;
      * **Engineer** -&#x20;
   3. **Pool** - Specify the pool you want to use. All pools and sub-pools that exist within your environment are displayed. A member with **Manager** and **Engineer** roles can belong to several different pools.
3. Click **Invite** to send the invitation email. Once the invite has been sent, you can view the invitation status on the **Invitations** tab on the **Settings** page.&#x20;

## Deleting users

You can delete a user using the **Delete** icon on the **Users** page.&#x20;

Before deleting, you'll need to choose another user who will take over all the assets of the current user. From the dropdown list, select the required user and then click **Delete** to confirm deletion.&#x20;
