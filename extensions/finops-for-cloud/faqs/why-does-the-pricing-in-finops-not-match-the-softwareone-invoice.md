# Why does the pricing in FinOps not match the SoftwareOne invoice?

SoftwareOne's FinOps for Cloud is designed to show your estimated costs for the current period, whereas billing management is only available when your SoftwareOne invoice has been issued.&#x20;

There are a few reasons why the amounts in FinOps and your invoice will differ:

* All amounts displayed in FinOps for Cloud are estimates for the current period, so they wonâ€™t exactly match your invoice. These estimated amounts are provided so you can make informed decisions about budgeting and resource optimization proactively.&#x20;
* Billing management presents data directly from your billing documents, such as invoices and statements. You can access this data only after these documents have been issued, and the amount will match exactly what is listed on your invoice.&#x20;
* Your invoice is generated at the end of your monthly billing period, whereas FinOps data is updated daily, so you can proactively monitor expenses.&#x20;
* Your FinOps account may show cost information from various cloud service providers, like Microsoft and AWS, whereas your invoice only contains subscriptions and items ordered through SoftwareOne Marketplace.

The following table summarizes these differences:

<table><thead><tr><th width="164">Component</th><th width="242">FinOps for Cloud</th><th width="249">SoftwareOne invoice</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Amount</td><td>Always shows the estimated amount for the current period. </td><td>Always shows the exact amount. </td></tr><tr><td>Subscriptions</td><td>Contains subscriptions from all cloud service providers.</td><td>Contains SoftwareOne subscriptions only.</td></tr><tr><td>Data availability</td><td>Available daily, even before the invoice has been issued.</td><td>Available monthly, only after the invoice is generated. </td></tr><tr><td>Other features</td><td>Offers enhanced features, like tagging policies and budgets.</td><td>Doesn't offer advanced analytics and monitoring.</td></tr></tbody></table>
