# How does FinOps differ from Billing Management?

FinOps for Cloud is designed to show your estimated costs for the current period. All amounts displayed within FinOps are estimates, so you can make informed decisions about budgeting and resource optimization proactively. The solution offers enhanced analytics and monitoring features that allow you to track your cloud spending and forecast costs effectively.

In contrast, Billing Management presents data from your billing documents, such as invoices and statements. You can access this data only after these documents have been issued, and the amounts match exactly what is listed on your invoice.&#x20;
