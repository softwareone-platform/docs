# Why does the consumption in FinOps not match the invoice?

All amounts displayed in FinOps for Cloud are estimates for the current period, so they wonâ€™t exactly match your invoice.

Your invoice is generated at the end of your monthly billing period, while FinOps data is updated daily (even before the invoice is issued), so you can proactively monitor expenses and optimize costs.&#x20;

Additionally, your FinOps account may show cost information from across your cloud service providers, like Microsoft and AWS, whereas your invoice only contains subscriptions and items ordered through SoftwareOne Marketplace.

As a result, the amounts in FinOps and your invoice will differ. Always refer to your invoice to determine the exact amount. To learn about SoftwareOne invoices, see [Understand Your Billing Documents](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/billing/understand-your-billing-documents.md).
