## How does FinOps for Cloud differ from Billing Management in the Marketplace Platform?

FinOps for Cloud is designed to show your estimated costs for the current period. All amounts displayed in the tool are estimates, so you can make informed decisions about budgeting and resource optimization proactively. Additionally, it offers enhanced analytics and monitoring features that allow you to track your cloud spending and forecast costs effectively.

In contrast, Billing Management presents data from your billing documents, such as invoices and statements. You can access this data only after these documents have been issued, and the amounts match exactly what is listed on your invoice.

## Why does the consumption in FinOps not match the invoice?

All amounts displayed in FinOps for Cloud are estimates for the current period, so they wonâ€™t exactly match your invoice.

Your invoice is generated at the end of your monthly billing period, while FinOps data is updated daily (even before the invoice is issued), so you can proactively monitor expenses and optimize costs.&#x20;

As a result, the amounts in FinOps and your invoice will differ. Always refer to your invoice for the exact invoice amount.
