# Re-apply Ruleset

The **Re-apply ruleset** option initiates a new check of the already assigned resources against the current ruleset.&#x20;

Selecting this option reorganizes the resources, even if they were explicitly assigned otherwise. This feature helps manage assignments, especially when rules are edited, new ones are added, or the priority of existing rules is changed.

To start the process:

1. On the Pools page, click **Re-apply ruleset**.&#x20;
2. Choose whether you want to re-apply to the entire organization or a specific pool. If you select **Specific pool**, then you must specify a pool and, if necessary, select the **With sub-pools** checkbox.
3. Click **Run** to start the process.

Re-apply options are available only if you have Organization Manager or Root Pool Manager permissions.
