# Assign Azure Subscription Owner Rights

As a Global Administrator, you can manage all Azure subscriptions and management groups in your tenant by elevating your access.&#x20;

When you elevate your access, you'll be assigned the [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) role in Azure at root scope (`/`). â€¯This allows you to view all resources and assign access to any subscription or management group in the directory.&#x20;

To elevate access, follow the instructions in Microsoft documentation: [Elevate access to manage all Azure subscriptions and management groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin?tabs=azure-portal), or perform these steps:

1. Sign in to Azure Portal as a Global Administrator.
2. Open **Microsoft Entra ID**. You can use the Azure search bar to find **Microsoft Entra ID**.
