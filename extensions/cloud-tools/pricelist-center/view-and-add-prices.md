# View and add prices

## Find a provider price list <a href="#finding-a-provider-price-list" id="finding-a-provider-price-list"></a>

Follow these steps to open a provider price list

1. Go to the **Pricelist Center** and choose a “Price List Type” and for some providers the “Region”.
2. Select **Search** to display the results of that provider’s prices.

## Filter Price List results <a href="#filtering-the-price-list-results" id="filtering-the-price-list-results"></a>

IaaS/PaaS Price Lists often have specific prices for certain Regions.&#x20;

For instance, Microsoft may charge a different price for an A3 Cloud Service or Virtual Machine, between a US and UK region.

Use the **Product Name** and the **Region** fields to narrow down the prices:

As a result, many A3 options will be displayed, but only based on those two regions. Here is an example:

SaaS Price Lists are different from IaaS/PaaS Pricelists from Cloud Providers. SaaS Price lists are based on what Subscriptions or Licenses are active for that SaaS Provider.&#x20;

To search for a specific Price for an Office 365 product, be sure to select the Office 365 Pricelist and type in a product name or select from an Active Tenant.

## Add missing SaaS prices <a href="#adding-missing-saas-prices" id="adding-missing-saas-prices"></a>

It’s important to add any missing price to the Pricelist Center, to ensure accurate Consumption reports are generated as you analyze spending over time on the **Consumption Overview** page.&#x20;

To determine what SaaS Subscriptions/Licenses require prices, go to the **Pricelist Center** and select the **Missing Prices** tab.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Missing Prices</p></figcaption></figure>

If this is the first time entering prices, you might notice several Subscriptions/Licenses with missing prices.

Add the proper pricing to each Subscription/License by selecting **+ Add new price** button. Note that adding prices requires a recalculation of the historical spending information within our system. This could take up to 24 hours to complete.

## Manage SaaS prices <a href="#managing-saas-prices" id="managing-saas-prices"></a>

After the SaaS prices are added, you can update them in the future or remove them if they are not accurate.&#x20;

To do so, navigate to the **Pricelist Center** and select **Customer Set Prices**.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Customer Set Prices</p></figcaption></figure>

On this page, you can see the current prices for SaaS products.&#x20;

By selecting **View**, you can review the history of prices and their start dates, for example, if you are renewing a contract with a different price or want to see how far back prices are applied. You can also view the historical prices, change prices, or add new prices.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you are unable to edit or add a new price, it might be due to your permissions. Contact your administrator to change permissions.
