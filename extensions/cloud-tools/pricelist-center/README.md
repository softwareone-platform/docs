# Pricelist Center

The **Pricelist Center** is a part of our Cloud Management experience. You can use the Pricelist Center to check the latest prices from IaaS/PaaS Cloud providers or set prices for SaaS Cloud providers.&#x20;

Many supported IaaS/PaaS Cloud providers publish a price list either based on current pricing levels or a list price for their service. In addition, those same providers offer Reserved Instances as a separate price list.&#x20;

SaaS Cloud Providers don't provide price lists, but prices have to be set by you or SoftwareOne.&#x20;

* If you are an Office 365 EA or Adobe client, you might need to set the price for each of your subscriptions/licenses and then update them by date, based on any changes on contract renewals.&#x20;
* If you are an Office 365 Simple client, SoftwareOne will automatically update these prices.
