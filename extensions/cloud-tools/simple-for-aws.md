# Simple for AWS

The Simple for AWS dashboard provides an overview for customers using SoftwareOneâ€™s Simple for AWS service.&#x20;

You can access the dashboard by navigating to the main menu of the Client Portal and selecting  **Cloud tools >** **Simple for AWS**.

## Dashboard interface

The dashboard is a single point of access to various sections of the platform and allows you to view your quarterly spending information, support tickets, service recommendations, and articles. It consists of the following sections:

* [Invoices](simple-for-aws.md#aws-spend-information)
* [AWS spend information](simple-for-aws.md#aws-spend-information-1)
* [Simple for AWS support tickets](simple-for-aws.md#simple-for-aws-support-tickets)

### Invoices <a href="#aws-spend-information" id="aws-spend-information"></a>
