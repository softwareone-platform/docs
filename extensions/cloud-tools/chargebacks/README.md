# Chargebacks

Chargebacks allow you to take existing cloud consumption and distribute the cost across the organization. Users can pull cloud consumption spend for direct and indirect agreements, define chargeback based on organizational structure, and create single or multiple internal chargeback invoice documents.

This is one of the last steps to achieving full end-to-end Cloud Management. Chargebacks offer the following benefits:

* You can create invoices, split invoices by provider, and then charge the respective business unit or department for the cloud services they are using.
* You can view, manage, and send internal invoices.
* You no longer need to manage this process manually in a spreadsheet.

## Setup requirements <a href="#setup-requirements" id="setup-requirements"></a>

Chargebacks depend on the Consumption and Custom Groups modules. Only the Consumption Module is mandatory.&#x20;

It is possible to generate a summary document and split it by tenants and subscriptions without further configuration. Custom distribution of costs across separate documents requires “Custom Group” to be configured and resources properly assigned.

### Access levels <a href="#access-levels" id="access-levels"></a>

Chargebacks have two access levels called User and Admin. If you need to get your access level changed, contact your SoftwareOne Account Team.

* **User Level -** Individuals with this access level can only see the **Chargebacks** tab. The **Add New Chargebacks** page will not be available to individuals with user-level access. User Level Access is for users who need to view chargebacks but don't need to create chargebacks. These users can then access the document details to analyze the charges using the Consumption module. This will give users detailed information on the relevant chargeback.
* **Admin Level -** Users with this access level can access the **Chargeback and Add New Chargebacks** tabs. Admins can view, create, modify, and delete chargebacks.

## Accessing Chargebacks <a href="#navigating-to-chargebacks" id="navigating-to-chargebacks"></a>

To access chargebacks, navigate to **Cloud tools > Chargebacks**.&#x20;

On the **Chargebacks** page, you can view the **Chargebacks** and **Settings** tab. You can also view scheduled reports, add a new schedule, or add new chargebacks.
