# Create a reporting period

A reporting period represents a period that you use to schedule budgets in your organization. For example, financial year, calendar year, quarters, or any custom time period.&#x20;

Each reporting period is treated as an overall budget for all Custom Groups. Therefore, it carries information like Budget Amount and Budget Owner.
