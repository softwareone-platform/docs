# Budgets

Budgets allow you to define cloud budgets and assign them to groups within your business or cloud service provider. You can assign individual budgets in the following two areas:

* **Custom groups** - Allows you to assign individual budgets to Custom Groups defined within Custom Groups. This allows you to manage time period and monetary values for your spending defined by your business.
* **Service Provider** - Allows you to assign individual budgets to Enrollments, Subscriptions, or Tenants (depending on the provider terms). Service provider budgets enable you to manage time period and monetary values for your spending tied to your providers.

To access Budgets, navigate to the main menu of the Client Portal and select **Cloud tools** > **Budgets**.

## Budget cost models

If you have purchased any Reserved Instances, you can choose between the following two cost models:

* **Actual Cost** - Represents Reserved Instance purchase cost as a one-time cost (single spend record).
* **Amortized Cost** - Equally distributes Reserved Instance purchase cost across months of the reservation time period.
