# Request to Create or Update Budgets

When you have limited access, you can't control budgets for your main Custom Groups or Subscriptions. Instead, you'll see a **Request** option for both types of budgets.&#x20;

This means you might only see part of your Custom Groups or Providers, depending on the permissions your administrator has given you. The budgets you can view are determined by your Spend Management access settings.

## Request a new budget

Follow these steps to request a new budget:

1. Select the **Request** option corresponding to the group.

2. In the **Budget Request** form, enter the budget amount and then confirm your request. The budget owner of the parent Custom Group will receive your request and create the budget.
