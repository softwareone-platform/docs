# Edit Budget Utilization Alerts

Both Custom Group and the Per Provider Budgets offer utilization alerts.&#x20;

You can set three thresholds that will trigger notifications for particular budget owners. These values are initially set by default, but you can adjust the percentage values by clicking **Edit**.
