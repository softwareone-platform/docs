# What model is activated when I purchase AWS through the Marketplace

Currently, the SoftwareOne Marketplace uses the End Customer Account Model (ECAM) for AWS.&#x20;

In this model, you retain control and ownership over the root access and domain associated with your linked AWS accounts. Meanwhile, SoftwareOne assumes responsibility for managing the master AWS account or payer account (with a SoftwareOne domain on the root alias).
