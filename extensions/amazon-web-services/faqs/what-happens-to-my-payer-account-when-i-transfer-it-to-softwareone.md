# What happens to my payer account when I transfer it to SoftwareOne?

When you transfer your payer account to SoftwareOne, your current payer account will be converted to a  SoftwareOne-managed payer account.&#x20;

This means the root alias of your payer account will change to a SoftwareOne domain. Additionally, your billing and tax profiles will be updated along with the deployment of certain stacks and guardrails, so that your account can connect with the SoftwareOne Marketplace and AWS Essentials offering.

Note that this process is manual, so our SoftwareOne experts will contact you to arrange the handover. The transfer will only occur when no active resources are consuming services on the payer account and all AWS invoices have been settled. Any active resources associated with the payer account must be moved to linked accounts, and all outstanding AWS charges must be paid before handover. This is to ensure proper invoicing on your account.
