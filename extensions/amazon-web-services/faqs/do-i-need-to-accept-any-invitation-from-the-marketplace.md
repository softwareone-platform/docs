# Do I need to accept any invitation from the Marketplace

If you requested to create a new AWS account through the SoftwareOne Marketplace, your designated notification contact will receive an invitation email.&#x20;

They must sign in to the AWS account and check for the pending invitation under the **Account** menu.&#x20;

Similarly, if you opted to transfer your existing standalone accounts to SoftwareOne, you must sign in to each account as an administrator and accept the invitations.&#x20;

The onboarding process will move forward only after the invitations have been accepted.
