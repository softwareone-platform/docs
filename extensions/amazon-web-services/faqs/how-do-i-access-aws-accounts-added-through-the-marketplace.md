# How do I access AWS accounts added through the Marketplace?

If you have connected your existing AWS accounts to the SoftwareOne Marketplace, your access to these accounts remains unchanged. The only change will occur at the Payer account level, where your root access to the Payer account won't work anymore after the transfer. See [What happens to my payer account when I transfer it to SoftwareOne](what-happens-to-my-payer-account-when-i-transfer-it-to-softwareone.md) for more details.

If you create new AWS accounts through the SoftwareOne marketplace, your notification contact will receive a notification when your AWS-linked account has been created.&#x20;

Once the accounts are available, you can access the newly created linked accounts using the **Forgot my password** link provided by AWS. You'll then be able to set a password for the newly created account and sign in.
