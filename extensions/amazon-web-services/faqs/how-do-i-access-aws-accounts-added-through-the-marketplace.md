# How do I access AWS accounts added through the Marketplace?

The access depends on whether you connected your existing AWS accounts or created new ones.

**Existing accounts** - If you connected your existing AWS accounts to the SoftwareOne Marketplace, your access to these accounts remains unchanged.  The only change will occur at the Payer account level, where your root access to the Payer account won't work anymore after the transfer. See [What happens to my payer account when I transfer it to SoftwareOne](what-happens-to-my-payer-account-when-i-transfer-it-to-softwareone.md) for more details.

**New accounts** - If you created new AWS-linked accounts through the SoftwareOne marketplace, your designated notification contact will receive a notification once the accounts are created. To access the newly created accounts, you'll need to reset the password by selecting **Forgot password?** on the [AWS sign-in page](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/). After resetting the password, you'll be able to sign in to your newly created linked accounts.&#x20;
