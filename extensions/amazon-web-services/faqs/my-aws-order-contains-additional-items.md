# My AWS order contains additional items

When you place an AWS order through the Marketplace Platform, certain additional items are included in your order by default.&#x20;

These include items such as Reserved instances, Savings plans, AWS service incentives, and more.&#x20;

These items are essentially placeholders that have specific permissions linked to your AWS account. You won't incur any charges for these additional items unless you buy them from AWS.&#x20;

For instance, if you don't purchase AWS Savings Plans, there will be no charges, but if you buy it from the AWS console, we will include it in your next SoftwareOne invoice and display it as a Savings Plan item along with the applicable charges.
