# Can I split my invoices?

Yes, if you already have a Marketplace agreement for AWS, you can split your invoices by creating a new agreement under your existing AWS agreement.&#x20;

To do this, open the purchase wizard for AWS and complete all steps in the wizard until you get the option to choose the transfer type. Then, select the **Split the cost of your organization** option.

Complete the remaining steps in the purchase wizard and place your order. A new agreement will then be created, and you'll receive a separate invoice for this new agreement.&#x20;
