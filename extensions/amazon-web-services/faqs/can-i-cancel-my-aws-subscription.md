# Can I cancel my AWS subscription?

You can cancel your AWS subscription by placing a termination order through the Marketplace Platform. There are two options for cancellation: unlinking accounts and closing accounts.

## Unlinking accounts

If you want to maintain your AWS account, but no longer through SoftwareOne, you can unlink the accounts. You can either unlink all accounts from the SoftwareOne organization or just select ones.&#x20;

Before unlinking accounts, make sure that your AWS account has a valid payment method, as this is a requirement by AWS. The linked accounts must be prepared to operate independently and have their own payment methods in place.

Once an account is unlinked, it will no longer be part of the SoftwareOne organization, and you will not receive invoices from SoftwareOne. For instructions on how to unlink your account, see [Unlink AWS Accounts](../tutorials/unlink-aws-accounts.md).

## Closing accounts&#x20;

If you prefer to terminate your AWS subscription permanently, you can close your account. For instructions on how to close your account, see [Close AWS Account Permanently](../tutorials/close-aws-account-permanently.md).

If you decide to proceed with account closure, we will guide you through the process to ensure that all necessary steps are taken for the successful termination of your AWS account.
