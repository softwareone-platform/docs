# Can I cancel my AWS subscription?

You can cancel your AWS subscription by placing a termination order through the Marketplace Platform. There are two options for cancellation: unlinking accounts and closing accounts.

## Unlink account

If you want to maintain your AWS account, but no longer through SoftwareOne, you can unlink the accounts. You can either unlink all accounts from the SoftwareOne organization or just select ones.&#x20;

Before unlinking accounts, make sure that your AWS account has up-to-date credit card details or another acceptable payment method listed in its AWS console. This is required by AWS. The linked accounts must be prepared to operate independently, with a payment method in place.&#x20;

Additionally, during the transition from unlinking from one master payer account to linking to another, the account must be capable of handling charges on its own. However, AWS provides a grace period; if you complete this switch within an hour, they'll not apply any additional charges to the registered payment method. Billing will smoothly transition from the original master payer account to the new one.

Once an account is unlinked, it will no longer be part of the SoftwareOne organization, and you will not receive invoices from SoftwareOne. For instructions on how to unlink your account, see [Unlink AWS Accounts](../tutorials/unlink-aws-accounts.md).

## Close account&#x20;

If you prefer to terminate your AWS subscription permanently, you can close your account. For instructions, see [Close AWS Account Permanently](../tutorials/close-aws-account-permanently.md).

If you decide to proceed with account closure, we will guide you through the process to ensure that all necessary steps are taken for the successful termination of your AWS account. For specifics that apply to AWS account closures, see [Close an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-closing.html) in AWS documentation.
