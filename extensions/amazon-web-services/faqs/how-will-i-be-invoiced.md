# How will I be invoiced?

SoftwareOne generates monthly invoices for your AWS usage, in line with the AWS billing cycle.&#x20;

Each invoice corresponds to a specific Marketplace agreement, with one agreement typically resulting in a single invoice. Within this agreement, all charges associated with linked accounts are shown for easier tracking.

Additionally, your invoice might include the following items:

* **AWS usage** - Reflects the total consumption of AWS services.
* **AWS support**\* - Covers any technical assistance or support services utilized.
* **AWS reserved instances/savings plans**\* - Displays costs related to reserved instances or savings plans opted for.
* **AWS other fees**\* - Shows any additional charges that may apply in specific circumstances.
* **AWS marketplace**\* - Shows any third-party products you purchased from the AWS Marketplace.
