### Select Microsoft Tenant

If you have multiple Microsoft tenants, you can switch between tenants. When you switch tenants, the values in the dashboard change accordingly.

As tenants are permission-based, not all users will see all available customer tenants.

### Permission-based widgets <a href="#block-bea31af0-a8d0-45a6-bd38-cdca3fe1497a" id="block-bea31af0-a8d0-45a6-bd38-cdca3fe1497a"></a>

The **Invoices**, **Add User**, and **Service Review** sections are based on user or content permissions. If you can't view these widgets, contact your administrator to check your permissions

### Product usage <a href="#block-ea488296-a0d5-4f23-b3c0-87a329f8d1bd" id="block-ea488296-a0d5-4f23-b3c0-87a329f8d1bd"></a>

The **Top 5 Subscriptions By Assigned** section can be used to evaluate subscription utilization and accompanying costs. Clicking the section redirects you to a full consumption report where you can see a detailed analysis.
