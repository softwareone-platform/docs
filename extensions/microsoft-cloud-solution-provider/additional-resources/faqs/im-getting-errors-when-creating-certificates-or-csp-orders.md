# I'm getting errors when creating certificates or CSP orders

If you encounter an error during the certificate creation process or when submitting an order, do the following:&#x20;

* Verify that your MPN ID is valid. You can check this in the Partner Center by navigating to **Account Settings** > **Identifiers**. Make sure that the ID is a valid Partner Location Account (PLA) ID, not a Partner Global Account (PGA) ID.
* Ensure that your reseller tenant is active and compliant in Partner Center.
* Verify that your CSP tenant's business address is in the same region as your distributor’s CSP region. If the regions don't match, you will need to onboard a new tenant in the correct region.
* Verify that your Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA) is fully signed and active.

This ensures that the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) ID associated with the Marketplace agreement meets all required criteria.

If these requirements are not met, you cannot create a certificate or submit your order, and an error message is displayed. This message comes directly from Microsoft, so it must be resolved before you can proceed.
