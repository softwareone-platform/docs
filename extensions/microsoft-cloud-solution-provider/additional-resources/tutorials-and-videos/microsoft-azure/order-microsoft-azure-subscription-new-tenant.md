* Your details, such as company name, registration ID, and address. You'll need to provide this information when creating the new Microsoft tenant.

1. **Create agreement** - Choose **Create agreement** to start creating your new agreement.
2. **Select licensee** - Choose if you want to use an existing licensee or create a new one. In this tutorial, we'll select an existing licensee. You can add a new licensee by selecting **Add licensee**. For more details, see [Create Licensees](../../../../../modules-and-features/settings/licensees/create-licensees.md).
3. **Create agreement** - Select **Create new cloud account** to create a new organization tenant with Microsoft, then select **Next**.
4. **Microsoft details** - Provide the following information:
   1. Enter the tenant name you want to use on the onmicrosoft.com domain and select **Next**. Make sure that the name doesn't include punctuation marks or spaces. To check the tenant name availability, see the [Access tenant name availability tool](https://onmicrosoft.platform.softwareone.com/).
   2. Provide the following details:
      1. Company name.
      2. Company registration ID or tax number.
      3. Company address, including city and zip/postal code.
   3. Fill out the **Primary Contact** form with the contact details of the person managing your account. Select **Next**.
5. **Additional information** - Follow these steps:
   1. If your organization is a [state-owned entity](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/compliance/anticorruption/criteria), select the checkbox. Otherwise, leave it clear. A company is classified as state-owned if it is either controlled by the government or performs functions that the government considers its own.&#x20;
   2. Enter the contact details for your support administrator and choose your preferred support language. Select **Next**.
6. **Items** - Select the Azure subscription item and select **Add items** to add it to your order. Note that for Microsoft Azure, there is only one item without any associated cost. When using Azure services, pay-as-you-go charges are generated against the subscription.
7. **Details** - Provide any additional IDs for the order and the agreement, then select **Next**.
8. **Review order** - Read the terms and conditions for the order and verify your order details. When done, select **Place order** to submit your order.
9. **Summary** - Select **View order** to open the order details page. Otherwise, select **Close**.
