# Order Additional Azure Subscription

This tutorial describes how you can order additional subscriptions for Microsoft Azure using an existing Marketplace agreement.&#x20;

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure that the agreement you want to use is in the **Active** state. Agreements in any other state cannot be used for ordering additional items.

{% stepper %}

{% include "../../../../../.gitbook/includes/purchase-wizard-1.md" %}

To start the process:

1. Navigate to the **Products** page.&#x20;
2. From the list of products, select **Microsoft Azure**.
3. On the details page, select **Buy now** to start the ordering process.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

{% include "../../../../../.gitbook/includes/in-the-purchase-wizard-com....md" %}

1. **Select agreement** - Select an active agreement from the list, then select **Next**.&#x20;
2. **Microsoft details** - Provide a name for your Azure subscription. Make sure the name meets Microsoft's naming requirements.&#x20;
3. **Items** - Select **Add items** to add the new Azure subscription to your order, then select **Next**. For Microsoft Azure, there is only one item without any associated cost. When using Azure services, pay-as-you-go charges are generated against the subscription.
