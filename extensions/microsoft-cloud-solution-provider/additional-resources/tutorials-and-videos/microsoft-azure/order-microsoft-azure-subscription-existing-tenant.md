Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

* An existing licensee in the **active** state or permission to [create a new licensee](../../../../../modules-and-features/settings/licensees/create-licensees.md) (if you don't want to use an existing licensee). You'll need to select the licensee when setting up the new agreement.&#x20;
* The name of the Microsoft tenant you want to connect.&#x20;
* The contact details of the person who will manage your account.&#x20;

1. **Select agreement** - Choose **Create new agreement** to start creating your new agreement.
2. **Select licensee** - Choose an existing licensee, then select **Next**. If you want to add a new licensee, select **Add licensee**. For more details, see [Create Licensees](../../../../../modules-and-features/settings/licensees/create-licensees.md).
3. **Create agreement** - Select **Connect existing cloud account**.
4. **Microsoft details** - Follow these steps:&#x20;
   1. Under **Primary** **domain name**, enter your existing domain name.
   2. Under **Azure subscription name**, provide a name for your Azure subscription. Make sure the name meets Microsoft's naming requirements. If you leave the field empty or provide a name that isn't accepted, the platform assigns a default name to the subscription.&#x20;
   3. Under **Primary contact**, complete the required fields, then select **Next**.
5. **Additional information** - Follow these steps:
   1. If your organization is a [state-owned entity](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/compliance/anticorruption/criteria), select the checkbox. Otherwise, leave it clear. A company is classified as state-owned if it is either controlled by the government or performs functions that the government considers its own.&#x20;
   2. Enter the contact details for your support administrator and choose your preferred support language. Select **Next**.
6. **Items** - Choose the Azure subscription item, then select **Add items** to add it to your order. Note that for Microsoft Azure, only one item is available without any associated price. When using Azure services, pay-as-you-go charges are generated against the subscription.
7. **Details** - Provide any additional IDs for the order and the agreement, then select **Next**.
8. **Review order** - Read the terms and conditions of the order and verify your order details. When done, select **Place order** to submit your order.
9. **Summary** - Select **View order** to navigate to the order details page. Otherwise, select **Close**.
