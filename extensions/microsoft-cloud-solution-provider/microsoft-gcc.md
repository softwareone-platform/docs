# Microsoft GCC

Microsoft Government Community Cloud (GCC) is an elite, purpose-built cloud environment designed exclusively for US federal, state, local, and tribal governments, and contractors managing data on behalf of the US government.&#x20;

GCC delivers a completely segregated instance of Microsoft Cloud services, including Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, engineered to meet the rigorous compliance and security standards that government entities demand.

Unlike standard commercial offerings, GCC environments are physically isolated from commercial cloud infrastructure, providing enhanced security measures, specialized compliance certifications, and robust controls tailored to government requirements.
