## Cloud Solution Provider Partner Program <a href="#enroll-in-partner-center-programs" id="enroll-in-partner-center-programs"></a>

The **Cloud Solution Provider Partner Program** allows you to partner with SoftwareOne as your indirect CSP provider. It means you'll purchase Microsoft products and services through SoftwareOne, but continue to maintain your relationship with Microsoft.

Partnering with SoftwareOne gives you access to valuable tools, resources, and support to manage your customer relationships efficiently. We also assist with customer support, billing, and provide guidance to help you scale your business.&#x20;

## SoftwareOne CSP Partner Program

The **SWO CSP Partner Program** is a program designed for SoftwareOne partners to ensure compliance with our established terms and conditions.&#x20;

All SoftwareOne partners must enroll in this program to obtain a compliance certificate, which is linked to all CSP products in the Marketplace. This enrollment is required before any purchases can be made.

Once you have completed your enrollment in the program, a compliance certificate will be automatically generated for you. You'll need to select this certificate when ordering CSP products and services.&#x20;
