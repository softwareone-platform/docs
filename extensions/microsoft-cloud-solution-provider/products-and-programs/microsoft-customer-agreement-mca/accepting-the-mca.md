# Accepting the MCA

If your Marketplace order is stuck in a **Querying** state because the Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) has not been accepted, you will need to accept the MCA for your order to proceed.

You can directly review and accept the MCA within the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?ref=/BillingAccounts/agreement).

**To accept the MCA**

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center using your Global Administrator credentials.
2. Navigate to the **Billing** or **Account** section, where Microsoft presents the MCA.
3. Carefully read the terms and conditions of the agreement.
4. Select the checkbox to confirm that you have read and understood the terms.
5. Select **Accept** to finalize your acceptance.&#x20;

Once you accept the MCA and Microsoft confirms your acceptance, your Marketplace order automatically moves from querying status to processing.

If your order doesn't automatically change to processing after accepting the MCA, select **Process** on the order details page to manually set it to processing.
