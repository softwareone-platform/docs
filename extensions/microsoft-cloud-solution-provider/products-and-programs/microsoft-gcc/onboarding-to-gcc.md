# Onboarding to GCC

This topic describes how you can start your Government Community Cloud (GCC) journey with SoftwareOne.&#x20;

The process depends on whether you are a new customer just starting with GCC or an existing GCC customer looking to move to SoftwareOne.

If you are a new GCC customer, you must verify your eligibility to gain access to the government community cloud set of products. To do this:

1. Complete the [Government Community Cloud Eligibility Intake Form](https://usgovintake.embark.microsoft.com/?ReqType=CSPCustomer\&rtc=1).
2. Provide SoftwareOne's Partner Tenant GUID: `141e07d1-6f28-4169-b951-316d5a941d88`.
3. Send your validation ID to Marketplace Platform Support at marketplace-support@softwareone.com.
4. Wait for the verification to complete. Microsoft typically completes validation within 5-7 business days.

For questions about the Microsoft validation process, contact the US Government Cloud Eligibility Team at [usgcce@microsoft.com](mailto:usgcce@microsoft.com).
