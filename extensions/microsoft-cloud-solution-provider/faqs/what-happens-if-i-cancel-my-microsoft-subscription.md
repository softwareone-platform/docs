# What happens if I cancel my Microsoft subscription?

You can cancel your Microsoft subscriptions by placing a termination order through the Marketplace Platform. The cancellation policy depends on the type of CSP product or service.

**For Microsoft Azure**

You can place a termination order for an individual subscription or the entire agreement containing multiple subscriptions. Azure usage is billed in arrears, meaning charges are based on usage from the previous month.

**For all other Microsoft products** (such as Microsoft Dynamics, Microsoft 365, and software subscriptions):

* **Cancellation within 7 days of creation or renewal** - If the termination occurs within 7 days of the subscription's creation or renewal, the subscription is canceled in Microsoft systems and terminated in the Marketplace Platform. A prorated refund is issued as per the [New Commerce Experience Cancellation Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/customers/new-commerce-cancellation-policy).
* **Cancellation after the 7-day window** - Termination orders cannot be placed for NCE subscriptions after the 7-day window. Any orders outside this window will automatically fail.

For details on how to cancel individual subscriptions within your agreement, see [Terminate Subscriptions](../tutorials-and-videos/terminate-microsoft-subscription.md). If you want to cancel the agreement altogether, see [Terminate All Microsoft Subscriptions](../tutorials-and-videos/terminate-all-microsoft-subscriptions.md).
