# What happens if I cancel my Microsoft subscription?

Microsoft subscriptions can be canceled by placing a termination order through the Marketplace Platform.&#x20;

A termination order suspends the subscription until it reaches the end date when it'll be terminated. A suspended subscription cannot be used, but it's still billed until the end date.&#x20;

The following cancelation specifics apply to Microsoft subscriptions:

* For Microsoft Azure, you can cancel a single subscription or the entire agreement containing subscriptions. Note that for Microsoft Azure, the usage is billed in arrears. It means you'll be billed as per your usage in the previous month.
* For all other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Dynamics and Microsoft 365, you can terminate or reduce the quantity within 7 days from your date of purchase. Subscriptions terminated or reduced in quantity within 7 days of purchase are eligible for a prorated refund. To learn more, see [New Commerce Experience Cancellation Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/customers/new-commerce-cancellation-policy).&#x20;
* Although Microsoft supports co-terming, the Marketplace Platform doesn't support co-terming for Microsoft products.
