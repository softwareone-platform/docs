# What happens if I cancel my Microsoft subscription?

Microsoft subscriptions can be canceled by placing a termination order through the Marketplace Platform. The cancellation policy depends on the type of CSP product or service.

**Microsoft Azure**

You can place a termination order for an individual subscription or the entire agreement containing multiple subscriptions. Azure usage is billed in arrears, meaning charges are based on usage from the previous month.

**For other Microsoft products** (such as Microsoft Dynamics, Microsoft 365, and software subscriptions):

* **Cancellation within 7 days of creation or renewal** - If the termination occurs within 7 days of the subscription's creation or renewal, the subscription will be canceled in Microsoft systems and terminated in the Marketplace Platform. A prorated refund will be issued as per the [New Commerce Experience Cancellation Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/customers/new-commerce-cancellation-policy).
* **Cancellation after the 7-day window** - If the termination occurs outside the cancellation window, the subscription will be terminated in the Marketplace Platform, and auto-renewal will be disabled on Microsoftâ€™s side. The subscription will remain active with Microsoft until the end of its commitment term, after which it will expire automatically.
