# How do I get the Microsoft CSP nonprofit qualification?

To access Microsoft CSP nonprofit benefits, your organization must first be validated as an eligible nonprofit organization through Microsoftâ€™s nonprofit eligibility process.

This involves registering on the [Microsoft Nonprofits Portal](https://nonprofit.microsoft.com/), where Microsoft will review and approve your status. It's important that your organization's legal name and tax ID used during registration match the information submitted for the nonprofit validation.&#x20;

Once your status has been approved, your CSP partner can create your customer account in Partner Center, ensuring that the organization type is set correctly as a nonprofit.&#x20;

After your nonprofit status is confirmed, you can access charity-specific offers and pricing.&#x20;
