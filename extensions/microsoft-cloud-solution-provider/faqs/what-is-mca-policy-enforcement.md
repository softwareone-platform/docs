# What is MCA Policy Enforcement?

Starting 7 October 2025, Microsoft is implementing a policy requiring customers to review and accept the latest version of the Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA).&#x20;

This acceptance is necessary for customers whose CSP partners attested to the MCA on their behalf before 1 April 2023.

While existing online services will remain uninterrupted, customers who don't accept the updated MCA won't be able to make new purchases, modify license quantities, including seat increases or decreases, make upgrades, or change their billing plan. To learn more about this update, see the official [Microsoft announcement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/announcements/2025-august).

### How to comply with Microsoftâ€™s updated MCA policy?

To comply with this Microsoft policy, the Marketplace Platform will automatically process MCA acceptance when the order is placed. The method depends on the tenant type and the individual placing the order.

**For Self-Consumption Tenants**

* **Client-placed orders** - If you are a SoftwareOne client placing an order directly, the MCA is automatically accepted using the details of the individual who placed the order. This applies to both new purchases and change orders.
* **Orders placed by SoftwareOne associates**
  * **Purchase orders** - The MCA is signed automatically using the Primary Contact details provided at the time of placing the order.
  * **Change orders** - You must accept the updated MCA through the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?ref=/BillingAccounts/agreement), using Global Administrator credentials.&#x20;

**For Resale Tenants**

* **Purchase orders** - The MCA is automatically signed using the Primary Contact details provided when the order was placed.&#x20;
* **Change orders** - Your end customer is required to accept the updated MCA through the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?ref=/BillingAccounts/agreement), using Global Administrator credentials.&#x20;

Orders requiring MCA acceptance remain in the **Querying** status until the latest version of the MCA has been accepted.

### How to accept the revised MCA?

**To accept the revised MCA**

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?ref=/BillingAccounts/agreement) using your Global Administrator credentials.
2. Review and accept the updated MCA.

Once accepted, your Marketplace order will automatically move from **Querying** to **Processing** status.

If you need technical assistance with your order, contact [Marketplace Platform Support](../../../help-and-support/contact-support.md). For legal inquiries, including questions about MCA terms, consult your legal team or Microsoft directly.
