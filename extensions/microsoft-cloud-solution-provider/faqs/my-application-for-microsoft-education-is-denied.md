2. Gather the required documents to support your eligibility.&#x20;
3. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and update the inaccurate details under **Settings** > **Organization Information**.
4. Request a reverification.&#x20;

After resubmitting the request, allow 3â€“5 business days for Microsoft to review your submission.&#x20;

To track the status of your request, visit the Microsoft 365 admin center.
