# Microsoft NCE

New Commerce Experience (NCE) is a specific update within the CSP program that introduces changes to the pricing, licensing, and billing of Microsoft’s cloud services.

Overall, the NCE is a more flexible and predictable option for clients looking for a longer-term commitment to Microsoft cloud services.

NCE’s primary objectives are to simplify transactions, enhance customer purchasing experiences, and offer flexible pricing options. It aims to provide greater transparency and predictability in costs. This enables organizations to scale their services seamlessly based on their evolving needs.

The move to NCE for seat-based offers took place in 2022 following the move to NCE for Azure (Azure Plan), Azure Reserved Instances, and Server-based Software Subscriptions in October 2019 and the launch of Perpetual Software in CSP in 2020/21.
