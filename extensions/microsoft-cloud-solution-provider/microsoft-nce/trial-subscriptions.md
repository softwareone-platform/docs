# Trial Subscriptions

The Marketplace Platform allows you to explore a Microsoft product before committing to a paid version. This means you can order a free trial subscription and try it out for 30 days.&#x20;

The following restrictions apply to NCE trial subscriptions in the Marketplace:

* Trial subscriptions don't automatically renew. When the trial ends, the subscription expires.
* Trial subscriptions can't be converted to a paid subscription at the end of the trial period. If you decide to order the paid version, you must place a new order for the corresponding paid product.
* Trial subscriptions usually come with 25 fixed licenses. This quantity cannot be increased or decreased.&#x20;
* No modifications or terminations are allowed during the trial period.&#x20;

### Identifying trial subscriptions

Trial items contain the keyword "trial" in their names so you can locate them easily. For example, _Dynamics 365 Finance Premium - Trial_.

Use the following methods to find trial-eligible items in the Marketplace:

* Use the **Search** bar in the top navigation area. Select **Items** and enter "trial" as your search keyword.
* In the main navigation menu, go to **Catalog** > **Items**. Then, apply a filter using either the **Name** or **Vendor item ID** that includes the keyword "trial".
* In the purchase wizard, go to the **Items** step, then use the **Product Item Name** filter to find the trial items you need.
