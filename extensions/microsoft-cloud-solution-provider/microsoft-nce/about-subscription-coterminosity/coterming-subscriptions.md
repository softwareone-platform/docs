# Coterming Subscriptions

There are two ways to align subscription end dates, depending on whether you are creating a new agreement or updating an existing one.

## Coterming when creating a new agreement

To align subscription end dates when creating a new agreement:

1. Navigate to the **Products** page, then select the Microsoft NCE product.
2. Select **Buy now** to start the ordering process.
3. In the **Select agreement** step, select **Create agreement**.&#x20;
4. Complete all the steps in the wizard until you reach the **Microsoft details** step.
5. In the **Microsoft details** step, select the **I would like to align subscription end dates within this agreement** checkbox. When you select this checkbox, all future subscriptions created within this agreement will be cotermed and aligned with the subscriptions created during the initial purchase.

6. Complete all the remaining steps to place your order.&#x20;

## Coterming for an existing agreement

For existing agreements, coterminosity can only be enabled for future subscriptions by [contacting Marketplace Platform Support](../../../../help-and-support/contact-support.md) and providing the end date for cotermination.&#x20;

When contacting support, ensure that the date you provide corresponds with an active, existing subscription in your tenant.&#x20;

To find the date, in the [Microsoft Admin Portal](https://admin.microsoft.com/), go to the **Billing** > **Your products** page. Then, identify the cotermination date based on the renewal or expiration date of an active, license-based subscription.&#x20;

The subscription you want to consider must be under the same Microsoft Partner.
{% endhint %}

When the date has been updated, all new subscriptions will coterminate with the specified end date. In the Marketplace Platform, you can view the end date in the **End date alignment** parameter on the agreement details page.
