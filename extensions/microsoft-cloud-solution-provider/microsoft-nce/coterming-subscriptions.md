# Coterming Subscriptions

In Marketplace, there are two ways to align subscription end dates, depending on whether you are creating a new agreement or updating an existing one.

**Align subscription end dates when creating a new agreement**

1. On the **Products** page in the Marketplace Platform, select the Microsoft NCE product.
2. Click **Buy now**. The purchase wizard starts.
3. In the **Select agreement** step, click **Create agreement** and complete all the steps in the wizard until you reach the **Microsoft details** step.
4. On the **Microsoft details** page, select the **I would like to align subscription end dates within this agreement** checkbox. When you select this checkbox, all future subscriptions created within this agreement will be cotermed and aligned with the subscriptions created during the initial purchase.

5. Complete the remaining steps as necessary to place your order.&#x20;

**Align subscription end dates for an existing agreement**

For existing agreements, coterminosity can only be enabled for future subscriptions by [contacting Marketplace Platform Support](../../../help-and-support/contact-support.md) and providing the end date for cotermination.&#x20;

Make sure that the date you provide corresponds with an active, existing subscription in your tenant. To find the date, in the [Microsoft Admin Portal](https://admin.microsoft.com/), go to the **Billing** > **Your products** page, and identify the cotermination date based on the renewal or expiration date of an active, license-based subscription.&#x20;

The subscription you wish to consider must be under the same Microsoft Partner.
{% endhint %}

Once the date has been updated, any new subscriptions created afterward will coterminate with the specified end date. In the Marketplace, you can view the end date in the **End date alignment** parameter on the agreement details page.
