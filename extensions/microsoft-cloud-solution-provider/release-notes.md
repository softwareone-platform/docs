### Auto-renewal for Microsoft subscriptions

Starting 20 May 2025, you can easily manage the automatic renewal settings for your subscriptions. This can be done by placing a configuration order through the platform.

Auto-renewal can be disabled to ensure that a subscription remains active only until the end of the current commitment period, after which it will expire without incurring further charges. If you disabled auto-renewal previously for a subscription, you can re-enable it at any time before the subscription expires.

Note that only NCE products support auto-renewal. Legacy subscriptions do not support this. For instructions on disabling auto-renewal, see [How to disable the automatic renewal of an NCE subscription](faqs/how-to-disable-the-automatic-renewal-of-an-nce-subscription.md).

## Release Date: 19 May 2025

### Microsoft subscriptions and FinOps for Cloud

Starting 19 May 2025, we will no longer use PyraCloud Cloud Spend Management for setting up new subscriptions for Microsoft products. Instead, our new solution, [FinOps for Cloud](https://portal.finops.softwareone.com/), will be used.

To start using FinOps for Cloud, you must place a purchase order for the FinOps tool through the Marketplace Platform. For instructions on the ordering process, see the [FinOps for Cloud](../finops-for-cloud/) help page.

Note that Azure subscriptions purchased through SoftwareOne are included at no extra cost within the FinOps tool. However, if you have Azure subscriptions that were not purchased through SoftwareOne, they can still be connected to FinOps for Cloud, but additional charges will apply.

### Support for Microsoft 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC)

We are excited to announce the launch of a new product called 'Microsoft 365 Business, Enterprise & Apps - Government' in the Marketplace Platform. This product includes a range of offerings designed to meet the specific needs of US government organizations. See [Microsoft GCC](microsoft-gcc.md) to learn more.

With this launch, you can seamlessly create new agreements in the platform and purchase nearly the full suite of Microsoft 365 GCC products through the CSP program. You can also submit different types of orders, such as change orders to increase or decrease the number of licenses, termination orders, and configuration orders.

To order GCC products through the Marketplace, you must already be GCC qualified. If your account isn't qualified, the platform displays a message. You must complete the tenant qualification in the Partner Center, as qualification can't be done through the Marketplace.

Note that this release doesn't include the Microsoft Dynamics catalog for government.

### Support for Azure Reservations and Savings Plan <a href="#azure-reservations-and-savings-plans" id="azure-reservations-and-savings-plans"></a>

In this release, we are introducing a new feature that allows you to purchase Azure reservations and savings plans directly through the Azure Portal. Reservations and savings plans help you save money by reducing your overall cloud spending.

The new feature is only available for Azure subscriptions ordered through SoftwareOne. When you purchase these two cost-saving options, the charges for these are billed on the date associated with your Azure plan.

Note that to buy reservations and savings plans from the Azure portal, you must have the Owner role on the subscription. To learn more, see [My order contains Azure reservations and savings plan items](faqs/my-order-contains-azure-reservations-and-savings-plan-items.md).

### Coterminosity for NCE Subscriptions

The Marketplace Platform now supports coterminosity for NCE subscriptions, allowing you to align the end date of a new subscription with that of an existing subscription. When enabled, new subscriptions will automatically synchronize their end dates with the existing subscriptions within the agreement.

You can enable coterminosity when ordering subscriptions under a new agreement. For existing subscriptions, [Marketplace Platform Support](../../help-and-support/contact-support.md) can assist you in updating the end date in the system. To learn more about aligning the subscription end dates, see [About Subscription Coterminosity](microsoft-nce/about-subscription-coterminosity.md) and [Coterming Subscriptions](microsoft-nce/coterming-subscriptions.md).&#x20;

### Azure Lighthouse Onboarding

The onboarding process for [Azure Lighthouse](azure-lighthouse/) has been enhanced to include the following changes:

* An order will no longer remain in a Querying status while the onboarding process is being completed. Instead, the activation link for Azure Lighthouse will be generated during the order processing phase, and the order will be marked as complete thereafter.
* You will receive an onboarding email when activating Azure Lighthouse is required. This email will include a link to begin the onboarding process.
* Onboarding can also be initiated directly from the Marketplace using the **Link to Lighthouse Approval Page** link. This link is available on the **Parameters** tab within the agreement details page.

### Support for Windows 365 Hybrid Benefit

As part of this update, a mandatory attestation for Microsoft is now required when ordering a subscription for Windows 365 Business with the Windows Hybrid Benefit. Users of the Client Portal will see the following text on the **Items** page within the purchase wizard:

"By proceeding with this order, I acknowledge that each person using Windows 365 Business with Windows Hybrid Benefit must have a valid copy of Windows 10/11 Pro installed on their primary work device."&#x20;

### New Agreement Restrictions for CSP Products

The creation of new agreements for CSP products using the same CSP domain across multiple clients is now restricted.

Additionally, creating additional agreements using the same CSP tenant, product, and licensee is also prohibited. If an agreement already exists, you must update the existing agreement to request new subscriptions instead of creating a new one.

### NCE Auto-applicable Promotions

Marketplace clients who have an existing CSP tenant can check their eligibility for an automatically applicable NCE promotion.&#x20;

If eligible, the updated price is shown in the order. However, if you qualify but don't meet the minimum or maximum license requirements, a message will inform you of the necessary criteria.

### CSP Relationship Request

If an order remains pending for more than 15 days due to an unresolved CSP reselling relationship, it will now be marked as **Failed**.

### Azure Lighthouse Onboarding Automation

[Microsoft Azure Lighthouse](azure-lighthouse/) allows authorized SoftwareOne associates to access your Azure resources seamlessly and securely.&#x20;

As a client, you can authorize SoftwareOne to manage your Azure environment by accepting our Lighthouse access request and completing the necessary onboarding steps. Requests can be accepted by navigating to the **General** tab of a purchase order and following the onboarding instructions. For details, see [Complete the Azure Lighthouse Activation](azure-lighthouse/complete-the-azure-lighthouse-onboarding.md).

Note that until the onboarding process is complete, any purchase orders for newly provisioned Azure subscriptions will display a **Querying** status on the platform. After completing the Lighthouse access request, be sure to update your order's status to **Processing**. For instructions, see [Change Your Order's Status to Processing](../../modules-and-features/marketplace/orders/set-an-order-to-processing.md).

## Release Date: 26 November 2024

### State Owned Entity (SOE) Qualification

Global regulatory oversight is increasing, and companies may be required to demonstrate that they have robust policies and processes in place to mitigate the risks of corruption and bribery. A critical first step in this process is the accurate identification of government entities, government-affiliated organizations, and their employees.

To streamline this, Marketplace clients will now have the option to specify whether a company is state-owned in new agreements. A company qualifies as state-owned if it's either directly controlled by the government or performs functions that are considered to be inherently governmental.

To learn about the eligibility criteria for state-owned entities, see[ Microsoft's State Owned Entity Criteria](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/compliance/anticorruption/criteria?oneroute=true).

## Release Date: 15 October 2024

### New Process Flow

We've updated the provisioning flow for Microsoft product purchase orders. Previously, the process was delayed by Granular Delegated Admin Privileges (GDAP) management, which could take up to 21 days. Now, the provisioning process will no longer wait for GDAP approval to complete the order. A time limit has been set, counting from the order creation in the Microsoft Partner Center, after which the order will be completed regardless of GDAP status.

Note that this does not remove the need for GDAP approval. For cases where approval is delayed or pending, services dependent on GDAP will remain inactive until approval is obtained. The sync process will be updated to handle such cases accordingly.

### Validations and Constraints

To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of purchase and change order fulfillment, updates have been made to the key validation processes. These improvements are designed to streamline the purchasing experience by reducing unnecessary delays and simplifying the workflow for existing users and accounts. The updates include:

* **Cart validation for existing users** - Ensuring that the items in the cart meet the requirements for processing, providing a smoother purchasing and fulfillment experience.
* **Billing profile validation for existing accounts** - Verifying that the Microsoft account billing profile is complete, reducing the risk of fulfillment delays.
* **Microsoft client agreement (MCA) validation** - Ensuring compliance with the Microsoft client Agreement, allowing for a more efficient order-handling process.
* **Removal of validation on ordering parameters for existing agreements** - This change eliminates redundant checks on established agreements, speeding up order processing for returning clients.

These updates aim to improve the fulfillment process by minimizing manual interventions and enhancing the overall client journey for CSP orders in the Marketplace.

### Support for Vanity (non .onmicrosoft.com) Domains

We have introduced an enhancement for existing CSP clients creating new agreements. Clients can now use their **vanity domain** (like, `<http://mybusiness.com>`) as the principal domain, instead of the default `mybusiness.onmicrosoft.com`.

This enhancement allows the SoftwareOne Marketplace to support Microsoft’s effort to create a more customized and professional experience by enabling businesses to represent themselves using their branded domain throughout the agreement creation process. This enhances brand consistency but also simplifies domain management for clients with established vanity domains.

### Subscription Fulfillment Parameters

We are introducing new parameters to enhance the subscription fulfillment process, improving tracking, accuracy, and transparency in subscription management. The new parameters are as follows:

* **Last successful sync** - This parameter stores the timestamp of the most recent successful synchronization, making it easier to monitor and resolve any sync-related issues.
* **Current seat quantities** - This parameter tracks the current number of active seats in a subscription, providing real-time visibility into the active usage.
* **Scheduled seat quantities** - This parameter stores the number of seats scheduled for future changes, ensuring that planned adjustments are properly documented and aligned with client expectations.

These updates will streamline subscription management, offering better control and oversight of active and scheduled seat quantities during the fulfillment process.
