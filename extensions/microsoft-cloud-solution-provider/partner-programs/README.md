## Cloud Solution Provider Partner Program <a href="#enroll-in-partner-center-programs" id="enroll-in-partner-center-programs"></a>

The Cloud Solution Provider Partner Program allows you to partner with SoftwareOne as your indirect CSP provider. It means you'll purchase Microsoft products and services through SoftwareOne, but continue to maintain your relationship with Microsoft.

Partnering with SoftwareOne gives you access to valuable tools, resources, and support to manage your customer relationships efficiently. We also assist with customer support, billing, and provide guidance to help you scale your business. For details on how to enroll, see [Enroll in CSP Partner Program](enroll-in-csp-partner-program.md).&#x20;
