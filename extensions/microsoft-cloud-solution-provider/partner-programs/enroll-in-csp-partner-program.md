The enrollment takes a few minutes to complete as we verify the details. Once the enrollment is complete, a certificate is created.&#x20;

When your certificate becomes active, you can use it during the ordering process. This means that when you create a new agreement using a [licensee set up for resale](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/marketplace-for-partners/how-to-configure-licensees-for-resale.md), the certificate will be displayed. You'll need to select the certificate to associate it with your agreement.
