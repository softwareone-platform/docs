# Order Additional Azure Subscriptions

If you already have an active agreement and want to order additional Azure subscriptions under the same agreement, you can place a change order.&#x20;

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure that the agreement you want to use is in the **Active** state. Agreements in any other state cannot be used for ordering additional items.

1. **Select agreement** - Select an active agreement from the list, then select **Next**.&#x20;
2. **Microsoft details** - Provide a name for your Azure subscription. Make sure the name meets Microsoft's naming requirements.&#x20;
