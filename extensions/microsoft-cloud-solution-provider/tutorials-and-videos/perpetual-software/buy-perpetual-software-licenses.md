# Buy Perpetual Software Licenses

This tutorial shows how to order a Microsoft [Perpetual Software](../../perpetual-software/) license. Perpetual licenses are licenses requiring a one-time payment. They are the licenses for which you pay upfront and then use the software indefinitely.&#x20;

To order a perpetual license, you'll need to create a purchase order. Purchase orders are orders placed under a new agreement.&#x20;

In this tutorial, we will assume that you are using an existing licensee and setting up a new Microsoft tenant.
