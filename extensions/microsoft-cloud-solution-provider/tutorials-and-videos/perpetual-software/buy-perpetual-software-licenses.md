# Buy Perpetual Software Licenses

This tutorial shows how to order a Microsoft [Perpetual Software](../../perpetual-software/) license. Perpetual licenses are licenses requiring a one-time payment. They are the licenses for which you pay upfront and then use the software indefinitely.&#x20;

To order a perpetual license, you'll need to create a purchase order. Purchase orders are orders placed under a new agreement.&#x20;

In this tutorial, we will assume that you are using an existing licensee and setting up a new Microsoft tenant.

## Prerequisites <a href="#howtoorderamicrosoft365subscriptionforanexistingmicrosofttenant-prerequisites" id="howtoorderamicrosoft365subscriptionforanexistingmicrosofttenant-prerequisites"></a>

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you are familiar with the [key concepts](../../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/key-concepts.md). You will also need:

* A licensee in the **active** state. Licensees are required for setting up a new agreement.&#x20;
* Your company details, like the company name, registration ID, and address. These details are required when setting up a new Microsoft tenant.
* The contact details of the person who will manage your Microsoft account.
