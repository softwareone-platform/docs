# Azure Lighthouse

Azure Lighthouse is a Microsoft solution that enables seamless multi-tenant management. It allows administrators to manage multiple environments in one place without switching between accounts.&#x20;

At SoftwareOne, we use Azure Lighthouse to deliver consistent and efficient management across all Azure environments. By leveraging automation and standardized operational processes, our teams can manage an unlimited number of client environments, regardless of size or complexity.

## Why is Azure Lighthouse crucial for your business? <a href="#why-azure-lighthouse-is-crucial-for-your-business" id="why-azure-lighthouse-is-crucial-for-your-business"></a>

Azure Lighthouse enables you to maintain full control and complete visibility over your Azure environment, while allowing SoftwareOne to provide expert management and support.

* **Full access control** - You define which users can access your environment, what resources they can manage, and what actions they are authorized to perform.
* **Complete transparency** - All actions performed by SoftwareOne are logged in the Azure Activity Log. This provides full visibility into what changes are made, when, and by whom.
* **Enhanced security and governance** - SoftwareOne engineers have read-only access by default, unless elevated permissions are granted through your explicit approval.

* We follow strict role-based access protocols, ensuring that our team only gets elevated access with your explicit approval, minimizing any potential risks.
* We prioritize transparency; every action is logged and fully visible to both you and SoftwareOne, ensuring complete visibility and peace of mind.

## What happens if you don’t activate Azure Lighthouse? <a href="#what-happens-if-you-dont-activate-azure-lighthouse" id="what-happens-if-you-dont-activate-azure-lighthouse"></a>

Not activating Azure Lighthouse might result in significant drawbacks for you and SoftwareOne.

**For you**

* **Limited visibility and control** - You'll have less granular control over which service providers can access your environment and the actions they can perform.
* **Higher costs** - Removing Azure Lighthouse access leads to increased Azure charges due to the lack of optimized management capabilities.

**For SoftwareOne**

* **Inefficient management** - Without Azure Lighthouse, SoftwareOne faces increased complexity when managing multiple customers, reducing the efficiency of service delivery.
* **Security risks** - Without built-in governance and role-based access controls, there's a higher risk of unauthorized actions within customer environments.
