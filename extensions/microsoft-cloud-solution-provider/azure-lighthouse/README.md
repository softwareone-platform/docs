## What happens if you don’t activate Azure Lighthouse? <a href="#what-happens-if-you-dont-activate-azure-lighthouse" id="what-happens-if-you-dont-activate-azure-lighthouse"></a>

Not activating Azure Lighthouse may result in significant drawbacks for you and SoftwareOne.

For you

* **Limited visibility and control** - You'll have less granular control over which service providers can access your environment and the actions they can perform.
* **Higher costs** - Removing Azure Lighthouse access leads to increased Azure charges due to the lack of optimized management capabilities.

For SoftwareOne

* **Inefficient management** - Without Azure Lighthouse, SoftwareOne faces increased complexity when managing multiple customers, reducing the efficiency of service delivery.
* **Security risks** - Without built-in governance and role-based access controls, there's a higher risk of unauthorized actions within customer environments.

If you have any technical questions or concerns about the Azure Lighthouse activation process, contact our **Services Support** team. For details, see [Contacting SoftwareOne Support](../../../help-and-support/contact-support.md).
