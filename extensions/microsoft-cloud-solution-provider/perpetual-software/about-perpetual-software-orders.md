# About Perpetual Software Orders

A perpetual license is a type of software license that requires a one-time upfront payment. Perpetual license purchases are also called one-time purchases in the Marketplace Platform.&#x20;

Unlike a subscription plan, which requires ongoing payments to keep the license active, a perpetual license remains valid indefinitely and doesn't require recurring payments. See [Perpetual Software](./) to learn more about this licensing model.

## Supported Microsoft products

The Marketplace Platform supports ordering perpetual licenses for the following products:

* Microsoft Perpetual Software - Commercial
* Microsoft Perpetual Software - Education

These products are available for ordering through the [Products ](../../../modules-and-features/catalog/products.md)page in the platform:

## Ordering process

You can order perpetual licenses for the supported Microsoft products by creating a purchase order. Purchase orders are created when you buy a product under a new agreement.

The steps to order perpetual software are like any other Microsoft product in the Marketplace Platform. For a general description of the ordering process, see [How to Buy Products in the Marketplace](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/marketplace-for-clients/how-to-buy-products-in-the-marketplace.md). For detailed instructions, see Buy Perpetual Software Licenses.

## Specifics you must know

The following specifics apply to perpetual software purchases:

* Perpetual licenses require a one-time upfront payment, therefore, you can't increase or decrease the number of licenses. To buy more licenses of the same perpetual software, you must place a change order. For instructions, see Order Additional Perpetual Software Licenses.
* Once your order has been completed and your license has been successfully set up, you can download your license keys from the [Microsoft admin portal](https://admin.microsoft.com). You'll need the key to activate the software. For download instructions, see Microsoft's documentation: [Download software and product license keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/download-software-licenses-csp?view=o365-worldwide#download-software-and-product-license-keys).
* Cancellations are permitted within 30 days of the purchase date. For details, see [Manage Perpetual Software Orders](manage-perpetual-software-orders.md).
