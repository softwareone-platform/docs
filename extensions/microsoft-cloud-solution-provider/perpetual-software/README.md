# Perpetual Software

As your trusted Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), we are excited to introduce you to a modern, flexible approach to traditional software licensing that combines the best of both worlds - the permanence of perpetual licenses with the convenience of cloud-based procurement through  Marketplace Platform.

## What is a perpetual license?

A perpetual license grants indefinite use of the software with a one-time payment. It means that once you have purchased a license, you can continue to use the software for as long as you want without any additional payments.&#x20;

Perpetual licenses differ from subscription-based licenses where access to software is granted through recurring payments.&#x20;

## Why choose perpetual licenses?

There are several reasons to choose perpetual software products, including:

* **Cost-effective, long-term ownership** - With perpetual licenses, you make a one-time investment in industry-leading Microsoft software that grants lifetime usage rights. This is ideal for organizations focused on budget predictability, as it avoids ongoing subscription fees.
* **Robust, comprehensive software suite** - Microsoft offers a suite of trusted applications, like Office, Windows Server, SQL Server, and more that are foundational to productivity, collaboration, and data management across industries. Once purchased, these tools provide long-term access to critical features without requiring a continuous internet connection.
* **Enhanced control & security** - A perpetual license means your organization retains control over software deployment, updates, and overall security. This can be especially valuable in highly regulated industries where stability and compliance are essential.
* **No ongoing renewal requirements** - Avoid renewal deadlines or license expiration worries. Perpetual software licensing provides peace of mind with indefinite access to essential programs, perfect for organizations looking to avoid disruption in their workflow.

## Who benefits most?

This licensing model is perfectly suited for organizations that:

* Have strict data sovereignty requirements necessitating on-premises software deployment
* Operate in regulated industries where cloud adoption faces compliance challenges
* Prefer predictable, one-time investments over recurring subscription costs
* Need specific version control for application compatibility
* Want to maintain complete control over their update and upgrade cycle&#x20;
