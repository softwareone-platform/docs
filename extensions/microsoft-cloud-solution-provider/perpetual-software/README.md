# Perpetual Software

A perpetual license is a software licensing model that allows indefinite use of the software after a one-time payment.&#x20;

Once purchased, the license holder can continue using the software without recurring fees or renewal costs. This model differs from subscription-based licenses, which require ongoing payments to maintain access to the software. This licensing model is perfectly suited for organizations that:

* Require strict data sovereignty, necessitating on-premises software deployment.
* Operate in regulated industries where cloud adoption faces compliance challenges.
* Prefer predictable, one-time investments over recurring subscription costs.
* Need a specific version to ensure application compatibility.
* Maintain complete control over their update and upgrade cycles

## Why choose perpetual licenses?

There are several reasons to choose perpetual software products, including:

* **Cost-effective, long-term ownership** - A perpetual license involves a one-time payment that grants lifetime usage rights for Microsoft software. This model supports budget predictability by eliminating recurring subscription fees.
* **Comprehensive software suite** - Microsoftâ€™s perpetual offerings include widely used applications such as Office, Windows Server, and SQL Server. These tools provide long-term access to essential productivity and data management features without requiring continuous internet connectivity.
* **Enhanced control and security** - Perpetual licensing allows organizations to manage software deployment, updates, and security internally. This approach is particularly valuable for environments that prioritize system stability and compliance.
* **No ongoing renewal requirements** - Perpetual licenses don't expire, removing the need for renewals and reducing administrative overhead. This ensures uninterrupted access to critical software tools.
