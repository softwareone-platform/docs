# Manage Perpetual Software Orders

## Cancellations

If you wish to cancel a one-time or perpetual software purchase, you can do so within 30 days of the purchase date without incurring an early termination fee. Cancellations are not permitted after 30 days.&#x20;

If your cancellation is within the 30-day window:

* All associated software keys and download links are revoked, preventing further use.
* You are responsible for discontinuing use, uninstalling the software, and removing any downloads or links.
* The canceled item will remain visible on the software details page in the [Microsoft Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com), but the activation key will be disabled.&#x20;

To cancel your perpetual software subscription, contact [Marketplace Platform Support](../../../help-and-support/contact-support.md#contacting-marketplace-platform-support).&#x20;

When contacting us, include your Marketplace order ID (available on the [Orders](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/orders/) page) in the request and a clear message stating that you wish to cancel your order. It's best if this request is made by someone within your organization who has the appropriate rights to request a cancellation.

## Renewals

License renewals are not supported for Microsoft Perpetual Software, as the license is provided for indefinite use following a one-time upfront payment.

## Additional licenses

If you wish to add more one-time items to your existing agreement, you can create a change order for the agreement. For instructions, see [Order Additional Perpetual Software Licenses](../tutorials-and-videos/perpetual-software/order-additional-perpetual-software-licenses.md).
