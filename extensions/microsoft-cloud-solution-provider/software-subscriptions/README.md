## What is a software subscription? <a href="#what-is-a-software-subscription" id="what-is-a-software-subscription"></a>

A software subscription is a modern approach to accessing software solutions where customers pay for usage over a period rather than owning the software outright. This model allows businesses to stay updated with the latest versions, updates, and security features. With Microsoft’s CSP Software Subscription, you gain access to a range of essential tools like SQL, and more, through a flexible, monthly, or annual subscription. This model ensures your organization has the right software to meet evolving business needs, without the upfront costs and complexities of traditional software licensing.
