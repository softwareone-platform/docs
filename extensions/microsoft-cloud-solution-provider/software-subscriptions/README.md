# Software Subscriptions

A software subscription is a modern approach to accessing software solutions where customers pay for usage over a period rather than owning the software outright. This model allows businesses to stay updated with the latest versions, updates, and security features.&#x20;

With Microsoft’s CSP Software Subscription, you gain access to a range of essential tools like SQL and more, through a flexible, monthly, or annual subscription. This model ensures your organization has the right software to meet evolving business needs, without the upfront costs and complexities of traditional software licensing.
