# Manage Software Subscriptions

## License keys <a href="#download-perpetual-software-and-product-license-keys-in-microsoft-365" id="download-perpetual-software-and-product-license-keys-in-microsoft-365"></a>

Once your order is complete and your license is successfully set up, you can download your license keys from the [Microsoft Admin Portal](https://admin.microsoft.com/). You'll need these keys to activate the software.&#x20;

For instructions on downloading your keys, see [Download software and product license keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/download-software-licenses-csp?view=o365-worldwide#download-software-and-product-license-keys) in Microsoft documentation.

## Cancellations <a href="#cancellations" id="cancellations"></a>

You can cancel your software subscription within 7 days from the time your order is placed and receive a prorated refund. This cancellation period consists of 7Ã—24 hours (7 days a week; 24 hours a day). Cancellations aren't accepted after this period for either new purchases or renewal orders.

For details on how to cancel a subscription, see [Terminate Subscriptions](../../../modules-and-features/marketplace/subscriptions/terminate-a-subscription.md).&#x20;

## Renewals <a href="#renewals" id="renewals"></a>

By default, auto-renewal is enabled for all subscriptions.

If a subscription is set to renew, it's processed the day after the subscription's term ends.

For example, if the term end date is 2023-03-01T00:00:00Z UTC, it includes the whole day. The renewal will start after the term ends (2023-03-02T00:00:00Z UTC) and can take up to 24 hours.&#x20;

Partners have a 7-day window (except where otherwise required by law) to cancel or reduce seats after the renewal is completed. The 7-day window starts at the date and time of renewal completion.

## Additional licenses <a href="#additional-licenses" id="additional-licenses"></a>

You can add more software items to your existing agreement by creating a change order. For instructions, see [Add New Items to Your Agreement](../tutorials-and-videos/add-new-products-to-your-csp-agreement.md).&#x20;

When ordering new items, you can't increase the quantity of existing licenses in the agreement. In such cases, a new subscription must be created under the same agreement.
