# Microsoft CSP

The Microsoft CSP program is designed to provide businesses with easy access to Microsoft's cloud services, such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure, through certified partners.

Working with a CSP provider like SoftwareOne offers numerous benefits and ensures a smooth onboarding process. These include:

* **Tailored solutions** - SoftwareOne can bundle Microsoft cloud services with additional offerings and services, creating customized solutions that meet specific business needs.
* **Expert support** - Gain access to dedicated support from SoftwareOne's experts, who can help with everything from initial setup to ongoing management and technical issues.
* **Simplified billing** - Enjoy the convenience of monthly billing and invoicing, making it easier to manage budgets and expenses.
* **Strategic guidance** - SoftwareOne provides strategic guidance to help businesses optimize their use of Microsoft cloud services, ensuring they get the most value from their investment.
* **Scalability and flexibility** - Easily scale services up or down based on business needs, with the flexibility to adapt to changing requirements.

## CSP product types <a href="#csp-products" id="csp-products"></a>

In the CSP program, various product types (or service types) are available, each with unique benefits and constraints:

* **License-based products (online services)** - Licenses for products such as Office 365 E3 are User Subscription Licenses; you need one license for each user. These products are also known as seat-based offers or license-based services and include all the Office 365, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Windows 365 products. When an order for a seat/license-based service is placed, a subscription is created. This is essentially a container that holds the licenses that have been ordered. A subscription may only contain a single license type (for example, Office 365 E3) associated with a single commitment term (for example, 1 year) and a single billing frequency (for example, annual).
* **Usage-based (Azure Plan and Entitlements)** - The Azure Plan New Commerce experience gives CSP providers access to Azure services at pay-as-you-go (PAYG) rates for CSP clients under the Microsoft Customer Agreement. This plan simplifies the purchase experience. You can have multiple Azure subscriptions in an Azure plan. In this new commerce experience for Azure, Microsoft has aligned to a single global pricing principle, enabling CSP providers to offer Azure at the published prices.
* **Software subscriptions** - Software Subscriptions are available for Windows Server and SQL Server, and for a fixed subscription term of either 1 or 3 years. They give access to the Azure Hybrid Benefit, which means that you may install the products on-premises or use them to license the products within an Azure virtual machine. See [Software Subscriptions](software-subscriptions/) to learn more.
* **Perpetual software** - Perpetual software licenses are licenses for on-premises Microsoft products that you acquire in perpetuity. In the CSP program, the software is license-only (L-only) and does not include the option to add Software Assurance (SA). See [Perpetual software](perpetual-software/) to learn more.
* **Government community cloud** - Microsoft Government Community Cloud (GCC) is an elite, purpose-built cloud environment designed exclusively for US federal, state, local, and tribal governments, and contractors managing data on behalf of the US government. See [Microsoft GCC](microsoft-gcc.md) to learn more.
