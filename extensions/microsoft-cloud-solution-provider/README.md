## Buying Microsoft products in the SoftwareOne Marketplace <a href="#buying-microsoft-products-in-the-softwareone-marketplace" id="buying-microsoft-products-in-the-softwareone-marketplace"></a>

The SoftwareOne Marketplace empowers clients to manage the entire onboarding process for Microsoft cloud services, from creating a Microsoft organization tenant to accepting the Microsoft Customer Agreement and beyond. Clients can track their Microsoft subscription purchases and manage the entire subscription lifecycle, all within the SoftwareOne Marketplace.&#x20;

By leveraging the marketplace, businesses enjoy a streamlined, efficient, and user-friendly experience, supported by SoftwareOne’s expertise and resources.

## CSP products <a href="#csp-products" id="csp-products"></a>

In the CSP program, there are various product types (or service types) available that each have their own unique benefits and constraints.

### License-based Products (Online Services) <a href="#license-based-products-online-services" id="license-based-products-online-services"></a>

Licenses for products such as Office 365 E3 are User Subscription Licenses; you need one license for each user. These products are also known as seat-based offers or license-based services and include all the Office 365, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Windows 365 products.

When an order for a seat/license-based service is placed, a subscription is created. This is essentially a container that holds the licenses that have been ordered.&#x20;

A subscription may only contain a single license type (eg, Office 365 E3) associated with a single commitment term (eg, 1 year) and a single billing frequency (eg, annual).

### Software Subscriptions <a href="#software-subscriptions" id="software-subscriptions"></a>

Software Subscriptions are available for Windows Server and SQL Server and are available for a fixed subscription term of either 1 or 3 years. They give access to the Azure Hybrid Benefit which means that customers may install the products on-premises or use them to license the products within an Azure virtual machine.&#x20;

Consider the Server Subscription as the best friend of Azure Reserved Instances since they now offer the most cost-effective way to license predictable Windows and SQL Server workloads in Azure through the CSP program.

### Perpetual Software <a href="#perpetual-software" id="perpetual-software"></a>

Perpetual software licenses are licenses for on-premises Microsoft products that a customer acquires in perpetuity.&#x20;

In the CSP program, the software is license-only (L-only) and does not include the option to add Software Assurance (SA). Software licenses available in CSP include desktop tools such as Word, Excel, Project, and Visio; infrastructure servers that include Windows Server, SQL Server, Biztalk Server; and productivity servers that include Exchange, SharePoint, Skype for Business, and Project Server.

### Usage-based (Azure Plan & Entitlements) <a href="#usage-based-azure-plan-and-entitlements" id="usage-based-azure-plan-and-entitlements"></a>

The Azure Plan new commerce experience gives CSP providers access to Azure services at pay-as-you-go (PAYG) rates for CSP customers under the Microsoft Customer Agreement. This plan simplifies the purchase experience.&#x20;

Customers can have multiple Azure subscriptions in an Azure plan. In this new commerce experience for Azure, Microsoft has aligned to a single global pricing principle enabling CSP providers to offer Azure at the published prices.

## CSP onboarding with SoftwareOne <a href="#csp-onboarding-with-softwareone" id="csp-onboarding-with-softwareone"></a>

Each step of the onboarding process can be executed by the client using the SoftwareOne Marketplace, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.

### Step 1: Creating a Microsoft Organization Tenant <a href="#step-1-creating-a-microsoft-organization-tenant" id="step-1-creating-a-microsoft-organization-tenant"></a>

1. **Consultation** - SoftwareOne will begin with a consultation to understand your business needs and goals.
2. **Setup** - They will then create a Microsoft organization tenant for your business. This tenant acts as a dedicated instance within Microsoft's cloud, housing all users, resources, and data.
3. **Configuration** - SoftwareOne will configure the tenant to align with your business requirements, ensuring optimal setup for security, compliance, and performance.

### Step 2: Accepting the Microsoft Customer Agreement <a href="#step-2-accepting-the-microsoft-customer-agreement" id="step-2-accepting-the-microsoft-customer-agreement"></a>

1. **Understanding Terms** - SoftwareOne will guide you through the Microsoft Customer Agreement, explaining the terms and conditions for using Microsoft’s cloud services.
2. **Agreement Acceptance** - They will assist you in accepting the agreement, which simplifies the purchasing process and provides clear terms regarding service usage, data privacy, and compliance.

### Step 3: Service Provisioning and Integration <a href="#step-3-service-provisioning-and-integration" id="step-3-service-provisioning-and-integration"></a>

1. **Service Activation** - Once the tenant is set up and the agreement is accepted, SoftwareOne will provision the required Microsoft cloud services for your business.
2. **Integration** - They will integrate these services with your existing systems, ensuring seamless operation and minimal disruption to your business activities.
3. **Customization** - SoftwareOne can further customize the services to meet specific needs, such as setting up user roles, permissions, and additional configurations.

### Step 4: Ongoing Support and Management <a href="#step-4-ongoing-support-and-management" id="step-4-ongoing-support-and-management"></a>

1. **Training** - SoftwareOne provides training to ensure your team can effectively use the new services.
2. **Continuous Support** - They offer ongoing support to address any issues and provide updates, helping your business adapt and grow with the evolving cloud landscape.
3. **Optimization** - Regular reviews and optimization services are provided to ensure you continue to get the most out of your Microsoft cloud investment.

## CSP and Granular Delegated Admin Privileges <a href="#csp-and-granular-delegated-admin-privileges" id="csp-and-granular-delegated-admin-privileges"></a>

For SoftwareOne to provide support to our customers, we require access to their workloads.&#x20;

Granular delegated admin permissions (GDAP) is a security feature that provides CSP providers with least-privileged access following the Zero Trust cybersecurity protocol. It lets SoftwareOne configure granular and time-bound access to our customers' workloads in production and sandbox environments. This least-privileged access needs to be explicitly granted to SoftwareOne by our customers.

With GDAP, SoftwareOne can provide services to customers who might be uncomfortable with the high levels of partner access. GDAP also helps customers who have regulatory requirements to provide only least-privileged access to partners.

## New Commerce Experience <a href="#new-commerce-experience" id="new-commerce-experience"></a>

The New Commerce Experience(NCE) is a specific update within the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program that introduces changes to the pricing, licensing, and billing of Microsoft’s cloud services. Overall, the NCE is a more flexible and predictable option for customers who are looking for a longer-term commitment to Microsoft cloud services.

The NCE’s primary objectives are to simplify transactions, enhance customer purchasing experiences, and offer flexible pricing options. It aims to provide greater transparency and predictability in costs. This enables organizations to scale their services seamlessly based on their evolving needs.

The move to New Commerce Experience for seat-based offers took place in 2022 following on from the move to NCE for Azure (Azure Plan), Azure Reserved Instances, and Server-based Software Subscriptions in October 2019 and the launch of Perpetual Software in CSP in 2020/21.

### What’s changing in 2024? <a href="#whats-changing-in-2024" id="whats-changing-in-2024"></a>

From 1 March 2024, education and nonprofit offers will now be launched in the new commerce system.

### What about the legacy seat-based offers? <a href="#what-about-the-legacy-seat-based-offers" id="what-about-the-legacy-seat-based-offers"></a>

Existing Commercial legacy seat-based offers can still be managed (quantity changes) and will continue to renew as legacy offers (until further notice)

## Subscription lifecycle states <a href="#subscription-lifecycle-states" id="subscription-lifecycle-states"></a>

When a subscription is created, it can have a number of states throughout its lifecycle.

### License-based New Commerce Subscription states <a href="#license-based-new-commerce-subscription-states" id="license-based-new-commerce-subscription-states"></a>

All NCE subscriptions are in one of six states: Active, Cancelled, Suspended, Expired, Disabled, or Deleted.

#### **Active**

Active is the default state for an NCE subscription. Whilst the subscription is in this state:

* Customers can access and use services.
* Admins can access service data and properties.
* Partners can access and make changes to the subscription properties.
* The transacting partner continues to be billed.

#### **Cancelled**

NCE subscriptions can be canceled within the first 7 days following subscription creation or renewal of the subscription. After the 7-day window passes, the subscription can no longer be canceled. When canceled:

* After a subscription is canceled, there's a 7-day grace period in a **Suspended** state where:
  * Customers can continue to access their data.
  * Partner administrators can back up data before it's removed.
  * If the partner purchases the same product/SKU equivalent to the one canceled, customer data and user license assignment settings are automatically restored.
  * If a new purchase is made with a lower number of licenses, customer data, and user license assignment settings will still be retained, and the partner should manage these appropriately.
  * After the 7-day period, these actions are no longer allowed, and data will be removed.
* Transacting partner will no longer be billed (pro-rata charges may apply)

#### **Suspended**

Partners can suspend (previously known as ‘Pause’) a subscription to temporarily make the services unavailable to customers. Whilst the subscription is suspended:

* Customers can no longer access and use services.
* Admins can access service data and properties.
* The transacting partner continues to be billed.
* Partners can reactivate the subscription before the end of its commitment term.
* Partners can cancel the subscription if it is still within the 7-day transaction window.

If the **Suspended** subscription reaches its end date still in the suspended state, it will now move to a 30-day disabled state.

#### **Expired**

Following the end of an **active** subscription term, a 30-day expired state follows. A previously active subscription will enter this state if auto-renew is turned off and the terms end. In these 30 days:

* Users can access files and services.
* Admins can access data.
* Transacting partner won’t be billed.
* Subscription can’t be reactivated.

After 30 days in the expired state, the subscription moves to a 90-day disabled state.

#### **Disabled**

A 30-day disabled state follows the end of a **suspended** subscription term:

* Partners that suspend their subscription leading to the term end will find their suspended subscription moved to this 30-day disabled state.
* After 30 days in the disabled state, the subscription moves to a 90-day disabled state (120 days disabled in total).
* Users can't access files and services, and only admins can access the data.
* Transacting partner won't be billed.
* Subscription cannot be reactivated.

**The 90-day disabled state** follows the 30-day **Expired** or a 30-day **Disabled** state:

* Data is retained for 90 days after the end of the previous state.
* Users can't access files and services, and only admins can access the data.
* Transacting partner won't be billed.
* Subscription can't be reactivated.

#### **Deleted**

After the subscription passes the 90-day disabled state, it stays deleted, which means:

* The subscription is nonrecoverable.
* If the partner cancels their subscription, the subscription will first go into the **Suspended** state for 7 days, and then to **Deleted** where data will be removed.
* Transacting partner won't be billed.
* The subscription cannot be reactivated.

### License-based Legacy Subscription States <a href="#license-based-legacy-subscription-states" id="license-based-legacy-subscription-states"></a>

All Legacy subscriptions are in one of three states: Active, Suspended, or Deleted.

#### **Active**

In the **Active** state:

* The default (normal) state of a subscription.
* Partners can access and make changes to subscription properties.
* Customers can access and use services.
* Admins can also access service data and properties.
* The transacting partner continues to be billed.

#### **Suspended**

In the **Suspended** state:

* Partners suspend a subscription to temporarily make the services not usable to customers.
* Partners can reactivate the subscription before the end of the term.
* If the subscription is still suspended by the term's end, the subscription is deleted.
* Partners can only reactivate the subscription.
* Customers can no longer access and use services.
* Admins can access service data and properties.
* Transacting partner won't be billed.

#### **Deleted**

After 90 days in the suspended state, the subscription will be deleted and is nonrecoverable.
