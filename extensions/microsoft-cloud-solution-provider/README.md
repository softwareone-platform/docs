# Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider

The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program was launched by Microsoft in 2015 and is a partner program that enables partners to sell Microsoft cloud services along with their own offerings and services. The CSP program is designed to help partners build a profitable cloud business by providing the tools and resources to manage their Customers' entire cloud lifecycle from provisioning, support and billing. Some of the benefits of the CSP program for the partner include:

* Access to Microsoft cloud services such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure.
* Ability to bundle Microsoft cloud services with your own offerings and services.
* Monthly billing and invoicing for Microsoft cloud services.
* Direct support for the Partner from Microsoft for technical issues

## CSP models <a href="#which-csp-model-is-best-for-me" id="which-csp-model-is-best-for-me"></a>

The Microsoft CSP program is divided into two models: Direct and Indirect.

### Direct model <a href="#direct" id="direct"></a>

In the direct model, partners purchase Microsoft products and subscriptions directly from Microsoft and sell them directly to their customers. The direct-bill model requires partners to sell to, bill, manage, and support their customers autonomously.

### Indirect model <a href="#indirect" id="indirect"></a>

In the Indirect model, Indirect Providers purchase Microsoft products and subscriptions directly from Microsoft and sell them to Indirect Resellers who then sell onto their customers. The Indirect Reseller owns the relationship with the end customer and is responsible for billing, managing and supporting them.
