Granular Delegated Admin Privileges (GDAP) is Microsoft's latest innovation in cloud security management, and it's transforming how organizations collaborate with service providers.&#x20;

GDAP is a sophisticated security framework that allows you to grant SoftwareOne precisely controlled access to your Microsoft cloud environment. This ensures we can support your business needs while maintaining the highest security standards.&#x20;

## Why is GDAP important? <a href="#why-is-gdap-important" id="why-is-gdap-important"></a>

In today's digital landscape, traditional all-or-nothing access approaches no longer suffice. GDAP addresses this challenge by introducing a nuanced permission system that aligns with modern security best practices. By implementing role-based access control (RBAC), GDAP ensures that service providers like SoftwareOne can only access the specific resources needed to support your operations, nothing more. This granular control significantly reduces security risks while maintaining operational efficiency.
