# Accept a GDAP Relationship Request

SoftwareOne requires Granular Delegated Administrative Privileges (GDAP) in your tenant to manage your Microsoft products and services. Without these privileges, we are unable to provide all the services associated with your purchase.&#x20;

After you have placed an order, you must accept our GDAP invitation. This invitation is provided as a URL on the order details page. When you select the link and log in as a Global Administrator, you are redirected to the Microsoft 365 admin center to complete the GDAP setup.

### Accepting a GDAP relationship request

To accept a GDAP relationship request:

1. Navigate to the **Orders** page, then select the required purchase order.&#x20;
2. On the **General** tab in the order details page, select the GDAP URL. You are then redirected to the login page for the Microsoft 365 admin center.
