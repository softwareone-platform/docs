# Accept a GDAP Relationship Request

SoftwareOne requires Granular Delegated Administrative Privileges (GDAP) in your tenant to manage your Microsoft products and services. Without these privileges, we are unable to provide all the services associated with your purchase.&#x20;

After placing an order, you'll need to accept our GDAP invitation. The invitation is provided as a URL on the order details page. Once you click the link and log in as a Global Admin, you'll be directed to the Microsoft 365 admin center to complete the GDAP setup.
