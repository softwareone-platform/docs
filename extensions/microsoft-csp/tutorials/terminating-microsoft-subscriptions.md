# Terminate Microsoft Subscriptions

If you want to cancel your Microsoft subscription, you'll need to create a termination order.&#x20;

Placing a termination order suspends the subscription until it reaches the end date when it'll be terminated. A suspended subscription cannot be used, but will still be billed until the end date.&#x20;

The following specifics apply to Microsoft subscriptions:

* For Microsoft Azure, you can cancel a single subscription or the entire agreement containing subscriptions. Additionally, for Microsoft Azure, the usage is billed in arrears. It means you'll be billed as per your usage in the previous month.
* For all other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Dynamics and Microsoft 365, you can terminate or reduce the quantity within 7 days from your date of purchase.
* Although Microsoft supports co-terming, the Marketplace Platform doesn't support co-terming for Microsoft products.

## Terminating all subscriptions

If you have several subscriptions in an agreement and want to cancel all subscriptions, you'll need to create a termination order for the agreement. Follow these steps to terminate the agreement:

2. Click the agreement name.

## Next steps

Once the termination order is placed, it's submitted for processing. You can check the status of your termination order on the **Orders** page.&#x20;

If you are within the 14-day return period, we'll terminate the subscriptions. If you are outside the return window, the termination will take effect from your renewal date.&#x20;
