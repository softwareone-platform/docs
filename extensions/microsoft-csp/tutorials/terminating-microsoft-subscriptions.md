# Terminate Microsoft Subscriptions

If you want to cancel your Microsoft subscription, you'll need to create a termination order.&#x20;

Placing a termination order suspends the subscription until it reaches the end date when it'll be terminated. A suspended subscription cannot be used, but will still be billed until the end date.&#x20;

The following specifics apply to Microsoft subscriptions:

* For Microsoft Azure, you can cancel a single subscription or the entire agreement containing subscriptions. Additionally, for Microsoft Azure, the usage is billed in arrears. It means you'll be billed as per your usage in the previous month.
* For all other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Dynamics and Microsoft 365, you can terminate or reduce the quantity within 7 days from your date of purchase.
* Although Microsoft supports co-terming, the Marketplace Platform doesn't support co-terming for Microsoft products.
