# Terminate Adobe Subscription

If you want to cancel your Adobe subscriptions within the 14-day return period or if you are outside the 14-day return period and don't want your subscription to auto-renew on the renewal date, you'll need to create a termination order.&#x20;

This tutorial shows how you can create a termination order.

{% hint style="info" %}
Adobe subscriptions can be terminated both within and outside the 14-day return period:&#x20;

* Within the 14-day return period - If you terminate a subscription within the 14-day return period (from the date your order is placed), the subscription is terminated and you are not charged.
* Outside the 14-day return period - If you terminate a subscription outside the 14-day return period, the subscription terminates on your renewal date. In this scenario, you'll see your Marketplace order as Terminated. In the Adobe admin console, you'll see an active subscription that terminates on the renewal date.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
