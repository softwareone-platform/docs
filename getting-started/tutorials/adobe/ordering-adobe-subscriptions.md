# Order Adobe Subscription

Buying from the Adobe VIP Marketplace buying program means purchasing subscription-based products. You subscribe to these products and pay periodically for their usage.&#x20;

To order a subscription, you must have an agreement. An agreement is a contractual relationship between a seller, buyer, and licensee. Therefore, each ordered subscription is part of an agreement.&#x20;

When you place an order, it either involves setting up a new agreement or adding to an existing agreement.&#x20;

This tutorial shows how to order new Adobe subscriptions by setting up a new agreement and a new Adobe VIP Marketplace account.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* An account on the Marketplace Platform.
* Your company address and contact. You'll need to provide this information when creating your Adobe VIP Marketplace account.&#x20;
* A licensee in the **active** state or permission to [create a new licensee](../../../platform-modules/settings/licensees/create-licensees.md) (if you don't want to use an existing licensee). You'll need to select the licensee when creating the new agreement.&#x20;

## 1. Launch the Purchase wizard

1. Navigate to the **Products** page (**Marketplace** > **Products**) and click **Adobe VIP Marketplace for Commercial**.
