# Terminate All Adobe Subscriptions

The only way to terminate all Adobe subscriptions in an agreement is by terminating the agreement altogether. This tutorial shows how to create a termination order for an existing Adobe agreement.

Adobe subscriptions can be terminated both within and outside the 14-day return period. To learn about the cancellation policies, see [What happens if I cancel my Adobe subscription?](../../../help-and-support/frequently-asked-questions/what-happens-if-i-cancel-my-adobe-subscription.md)

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the agreement you want to terminate is **Active**. Agreements in any other state cannot be terminated.

## 1. Open the agreement

1. Navigate to the **Agreements** page (**Marketplace** > **Agreements**) and locate the agreement containing subscriptions you want to terminate.&#x20;
2. Click the agreement name. The following image shows an example agreement:
