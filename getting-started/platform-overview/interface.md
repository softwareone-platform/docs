## Navigating the interface

* **Navigation menu** - Clicking the main menu displays the platform modules that you have access to, along with your recently viewed modules and favorites.
* **Help icon** - Clicking the **Help** icon opens a menu containing links to resources, such as the [SoftwareOne blog](https://www.softwareone.com/en/blog/articles), product documentation, and news and events. You can also access the **Help and Support** page from this menu.
* **Notifications** - Clicking the notifications icon opens the **Notifications** page. For more information, see [View notifications](basics/view-notifications.md).
* **Profile menu** - Displays the name of your account and the account type along with your username. Clicking the profile menu enables you to [manage your profile](basics/manage-profile.md), [switch accounts](basics/switch-account.md) (only if you belong to multiple accounts), and sign out of your account.&#x20;

### Using the primary content section

The primary content section is the main working area that displays data and allows you to view information and complete tasks depending on your role and permissions.&#x20;

The layout of the content area depends on the module and the type of data it displays. It can include elements, such as tables.
