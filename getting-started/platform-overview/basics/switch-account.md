# Switch Account

The Marketplace Platform allows an individual to be linked to several accounts.&#x20;

If you belong to multiple accounts, you can conveniently switch between those accounts without signing out of the platform. Switching can be done through your user profile menu.

{% hint style="info" %}
The option to switch accounts is only available for members of multiple accounts.
{% endhint %}

1. Sign in to your account.&#x20;
2. Click your profile menu in the header. Your associated accounts are displayed under **Switch account**.
