# View notifications

The **Notification** page displays all notifications and allows you to manage them easily.  There are two types of notifications in Marketplace Platform:

* **System notifications** - These notifications are associated with your profile. You cannot subscribe or unsubscribe from these notifications.
* **User notifications** - These notifications are also called feature notifications. These notifications are sent only if you are subscribed to receive them.

By default, the system deletes all notifications after 30 days, regardless of whether you've read them.

## View your notifications

You can view new notifications by clicking the bell icon in the header.&#x20;
