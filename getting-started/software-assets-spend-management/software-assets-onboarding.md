# Software assets onboarding

You can configure Software Assets integration through **Cloud Tenant Setup** (**Setup** > **Cloud Tenant Setup**).

In Cloud Tenant Setup, you can enable software assets integration by selecting **Activate**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: The Software Assets row is only visible for the admin accounts.
{% endhint %}

After selecting **Activate**, the activated account will be visible in Spend Management (Resources / Budgets / Consumption ) within 24 hours.

### Managing integration settings

You can access the additional configuration of the integration by selecting **Manage**. You can control transaction filtering or turn off the integration.

By default, filtering is turned on. This means that transactions relating to Azure or O365 will not be visible in the Spend Management modules.

Any changes to filtering settings will take effect after 24 hours.

Take caution when disabling software asset integration. You can always enable it again, however, all transaction allocation and/or tag assignments will need to be re-done.
