* In the main menu, hover over the page and select the star icon.&#x20;

The star icon will change from empty to filled, and the page will appear under **Favorites** in the main menu.

You can remove a page from your favorites in two different ways.

**To remove a page from your favorites**

* In the main menu, go to **Favorites** and select the star icon next to the page you want to remove.

* In the main menu, navigate to the module that contains the page and select the star icon.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
