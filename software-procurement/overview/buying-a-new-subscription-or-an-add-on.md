# Buying a new subscription or an add-on

***

### Buying a new subscription

In the Cloud Subscriptions Marketplace, you can purchase new subscriptions and add-ons from the Microsoft CSP program.

The Cloud Subscriptions page displays the most popular categories as well as the most popular subscriptions. Selecting a category displays a list of products that are available within that category along with pricing details.

**To buy a new subscription**

1. Select **Buy Now** on the Cloud Subscriptions Marketplace page.
2. Choose the tenant for which you want to buy a new subscription. The Tenant list contains all of your Microsoft tenants where the reseller relationship has been established and onboarded.
3. Choose the commitment term and your billing frequency.
4. Enter the quantity and select **Buy Now**. The Order Subscription page displays where you can change the following details:
   * **Subscription Name**: Provide an individual name for your subscription, for example, Office 365 E3 for Marketing.
   * **License** **Quantity**: Enter the number of licenses required.
   * **Billing Cycle**: Monthly or Annual billing options are available.
   * **Your Internal Details**: You can enter order-specific details that you may need for later internal cost allocation and billing purposes.
5. Once you have added the details, select the consent checkbox and select **Order Subscription** to complete your order.

### Buying an add-on

After selecting **Buy Now**, the **Order Subscription** wizard will appear which will guide you through the whole purchasing process. You can choose whether you want to purchase the **Add-on** for **Your Existing Base Subscription** or if you want to purchase a **New Base Subscription**.

If you want to buy a New Base Subscription, enter the following fields:&#x20;

* **Subscription Name:** Give an individual name for your subscription like “Office 365 E3 for Marketing”
* **License Quantity**: Enter the number of licenses required
* **Billing Cycle**: Monthly or Annual billing options are available
* **Your Internal Details**: You can enter order-specific details that you may need for later internal cost allocation and billing purposes

After you have finished the Base Subscription step, select **Next** and setup your **Add-on** details. The fields are the same as for the Base Subscription but you can fill in different values as you need.

Once you have finished the Add-on detail page step, select **Next** and check your order summary.

Once you have checked the order summary, select the consent checkbox and click on **Order Subscription**. A confirmation message will be displayed.
