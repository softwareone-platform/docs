# Understanding my 365Simple subscriptions

***

### Viewing your tenant and contract details <a href="#tenant-and-contract-details" id="tenant-and-contract-details"></a>

The My Subscriptions page displays your tenant and contract details along with a list of your current and recently deleted subscriptions and add-ons.

When the My Subscriptions page first loads, your selected tenant and total monthly cost are displayed. Your tenant and contract details are hidden by default.

**To view your tenant and contract details**

1. Select **Tenant & Contract Details**.
2. When the tenant and contract details section is expanded, your Microsoft tenant domain and ID are displayed beside the details of your 365Simple contract.
3. Select **View Contract** to see your 365Simple contract in detail.
4. Select **Tenant & Contract Details** again to hide the details.

### Subscriptions and Add-ons List <a href="#subscriptions-and-add-ons-list" id="subscriptions-and-add-ons-list"></a>

Your 365Simple subscriptions and add-ons are displayed in a single flat list.

#### Basic Information <a href="#basic-information" id="basic-information"></a>

Each subscription or add-on in the list is displayed with the following information:

* **Product Name**: This is the name of the product the subscription is for and is displayed in larger bold lettering at the top left of each subscription.
* **Subscription Name**: This is a friendly name for the subscription.
* **Status**: This is the current status of the subscription as it stands in your Microsoft tenant. This does not reflect any planned changes in unsubmitted change requests. Subscriptions are either Active, Suspended, or Deleted
* **License Quantity**: This is the current quantity of the subscription as it stands in your Microsoft tenant. This does not reflect any planned changes in unsubmitted change requests.
* **Monthly Price / Unit**: This is the current cost per license (or other unit, e.g. Gb for extra file storage add-ons).
* **Total Monthly Cost**: This is calculated as License Quantity multiple by Monthly Price / Unit. When a subscription or add-on is in Suspended or Deleted status, the Total Monthly Cost is zero.

#### Chips <a href="#chips" id="chips"></a>

In addition to this information, each subscription or add-on in the list may also show “chips” to provide more information as shown below:

The chips represent the following:

* **Open Change Request**: This chip indicates that the subscription or add-on has pending changes in a Change Request that has not been submitted yet.
* **Add-on**: This chip indicates that the subscribed product is an add-on and belongs to a parent subscription.
* **Trial 1/1**: This chip indicates that the subscription or add-on is a trial. Generally speaking, trials last for 30 days. In some cases, a product can be trialed more than once. The numbers after the trial indicate how many trials have been conducted, and the total number of trials possible.
* **105 days to reactivate**: This chip indicates the number of days left to reactivate a suspended subscription before it is deleted. When a subscription or add-on is suspended, you have up to 90 days to reactivate it (plus the remaining days in the current billing cycle). When this number reaches zero, the subscription or add-on will be deleted, and all data will be permanently destroyed.
* **Deleted 5 days ago**: This chip indicates how long ago a suspended subscription was deleted. After a subscription has been deleted for 15 days, the subscription will no longer be shown in the subscription and add-on list in Cloud Subscriptions: Manage.
