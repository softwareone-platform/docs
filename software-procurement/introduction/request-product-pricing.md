# Request Product Pricing

If you do not see pricing information for the product you are looking for, you can create a special quote for non-catalog products.

Users can also create a Special Quote Request for a product in the following scenarios:

* An item is no longer in your catalog
* The price is no longer valid but is still in your catalog
* You need to search outside of your catalog from top publishers

<figure><img src="https://help.pyracloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10-1024x541.png" alt="" height="541" width="1024"><figcaption><p><em><strong>Figure 7 – Special Quote Request Scenarios</strong></em></p></figcaption></figure>

### Special Quote Creation <a href="#special-quote-creation" id="special-quote-creation"></a>

After accessing the special quote request page, enter all of the required information.

**Note:** The publisher and products fields will offer you suggestions from the current catalog. However, you can still enter your own entries if there is no suitable result.

<figure><img src="https://help.pyracloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-152-1024x749.png" alt="" height="749" width="1024"><figcaption><p><strong>Figure 8 – Special Quote Request Page</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Checking the “Renewal” checkbox indicates that this request is not for a new product but instead the renewal of existing product.

When you enter Publsiher details, an additional section will open where you can enter details of the products specific to that publisher as shown below:

You need to enter at least one Product to submit a request.

<figure><img src="https://help.pyracloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12.png" alt="" height="713" width="825"><figcaption><p><strong>Figure 9 – Additional Product fields for Selected Publsiher</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Click on the “Add … Product” button to request additional publisher products.

All requested products will be assigned to one request, however they will be displayed in separate row for each requested product as shown below.

As this is one single request, all of the attached documents will be visible on any of the “Detail pages” that share the same Request No.

Once you click “Submit” you will see a confirmation message which includes the special quote “Document Number” as shown below:\

You have the option to select whether you would like to receive an email confirmation by clicking “Yes” or “No”. Clicking any of these two options will take you back to the products page.

You can also create a special quote from the “Request Special Quote from our Team” button at the bottom of the Product & Services page as shown below:\

### Switching between different products of the same request <a href="#switching-between-different-products-of-the-same-request" id="switching-between-different-products-of-the-same-request"></a>

As described in the previous section each Product Request is represented in a separate row in the Special Quotes Overview, even if they are from the same request.

When looking at the details of a special quote, you will see any other products that are part of the same request displayed in a box on the top left corner “Other products” as shown below:

<figure><img src="https://help.pyracloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-153.png" alt="" height="509" width="380"><figcaption><p><strong>Figure 13 – Multiple Product Requests</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

Each entry links to the respective product so that it is easy to switch between the products.

### Deleting multiple product requests <a href="#deleting-multiple-product-requests" id="deleting-multiple-product-requests"></a>

Deleting multiple product requests can be done in the usual way. It is possible to trigger the deletion from any of the products of the request.

**Note:** Please note that the whole request with all of the requested products will be deleted. It is not possible to delete only a single product request from a multple product request.

### Finding your Special Quotes <a href="#finding-your-special-quotes" id="finding-your-special-quotes"></a>
