# Manage Transactions

Procurement Workbench consolidates all of the procurement features that our procurement users need to manage software transactions.

### Navigating to Procurement Workbench <a href="#navigating-to-procurement-workbench" id="navigating-to-procurement-workbench"></a>

To navigate to Procurement Workbench click on Buy in the main navigation and then select Procurement Workbench from the menu.

This will take you to the Procurement Workbench page.

There are mini tiles on the Procurement Workbench and each tile is a stage in the procurement process. You can see these tiles under the Transaction Status and Actions heading – Open Requests, Quotes Ready, Approval Required, Open Invoices and Invoices Overdue.

### Open Requests <a href="#open-requests" id="open-requests"></a>

In the Open Request tab you can see all the special quotes that are open.

**Note**: SoftwareONE offers millions of products for customers to buy. Frequently bought products are added to the customer’s item catalog. PyraCloud also provides users with a way to request products and pricing information which are not in their product catalog. This can be done by creating special quotes for non-catalog products. You can read more details in our [Special Quotes knowledge article](https://help.pyracloud.com/knowledge-base/requesting-pricing-for-non-catalog-products/).

Once a special quote has been completed, it will no longer show in this section.

Within the grid view you can:

* Sort the list
* Filter the records based on any specific value for columns
* Customize the grid by adding /removing columns
* Group by columns

You can also raise a new quote by clicking on the “Request Special Quote” button at the top of the grid.
