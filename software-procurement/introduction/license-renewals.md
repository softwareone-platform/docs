# License Renewals

You can manage your software license renewals in PyraCloud through Renewal Manager.

Renewal Manager enables you to collect, track and manage contractual and software maintenance renewals independent of the software license supplier or distribution channel.

**Sub Tab – Agreements**

This list shows agreements with a defined end date. This means that for those agreements, it is necessary to define a certain date in the future when the agreement must be renewed or terminated.

**Sub Tab – Evergreen Agreements**

This list shows agreements which do not have an end date. For example, Transactual License Agreements for perpetual licenses without any maintenance will be listed in this sub tab. Also, Master Agreements like Microsoft MPSA or Adobe VIP Agreements can be found in here.

**Sub Tab – Archive**

This list shows the agreements that have been archived. You can archive agreements if they have been set to ‘Renewed’ or ‘Terminated’. If the renewal process for an agreement is currently “in progress”, you will not be able to archive it.

You can archive single agreements by using the “action” available in the grid view. If you want to archive multiple agreements in one go, use the [bulk action](broken-reference) option.

**Sub Tab – Under Maintenance**

This list shows new agreements purchased through SoftwareONE, as well as agreements imported from Entitlement Manager which have missing data and therefore cannot be managed by Renewal Manager. If there are no incomplete agreements existing, this sub tab won’t be visible.

#### Estimated Renewal Cost Calculation <a href="#estimated-renewal-cost-calculation" id="estimated-renewal-cost-calculation"></a>

The Estimated Renewal Costs get calculated by considering the following parameters:

**Formula of the Renewal Cost Calculation:**

‘Current Cost’ x ‘Renewal Factor’ / ‘Current Period’ x ‘Renewal Period’

* Current Cost: Paid costs of the initial transaction
* Renewal Factor depending on the License Type
  * License & Maintenance = 20%
  * Maintenance = 100%
  * Subscription = 100%
  * Support = 100%
  * Services = 0%
  * License = 0%
* Current Period: License Period of the initial transaction
* Renewal Period: License Period of the Renewal

**Calculation Example**:

* License Type: License & Maintenance
* Renewal Factor: 20%
* Current Cost: 5.000,00
* Current Period: 01 Jan 2019 – 31 Dec 2019
* Renewal Period: 01 Jan 2020 – 31 Dec 2020
* **Calculation: 5.000,00 x 20% / 365 days x 365 days = 1.000.00**

#### Agreement Details Tab <a href="#post-796-_toc14239622" id="post-796-_toc14239622"></a>

The Agreement Details Tab provides you with agreement descriptions, categorisations and dates. For example, Contract Numbers, Agreement Owner, Publiser, End Date, Anniversary Date, and much more.

Within the Costs tab you can use two diagrams to analyze the costs on a timeline – a Bar Chart and a Gant Chart.

#### Bar Chart <a href="#post-796-_toc14180242" id="post-796-_toc14180242"></a>

The Bar Chart shows you the costs on a time line with the option to switch between different views – per Month, Quarter or Year. You can as well navigate back and forth within the chart.

You can use the “Cost By” drop down to switch to a stacked bar chart. You can choose between Cost By:

* Agreements
* Publisher
* Cost Type (Paid/Still to Pay/Renewal Costs)
* Tag

If you click on one of the stacked bars in the chart you are going to drill down into this bar. If you click on one of the drilled down bars you will see a list open beneath the chart e.g. list of agreements (as shown below).

#### Gantt Chart <a href="#post-796-_toc14180243" id="post-796-_toc14180243"></a>

The Gantt Chart will show you a list of your agreements with a visual representation of the time frame for each agreement, split into the active period and renewal period.

<figure><img src="https://help.pyracloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Gantt-Chart-1024x771.png" alt="" height="771" width="1024"><figcaption><p><strong>Figure 49 – Gantt Chart</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

If you hover your mouse curser over one of the bars, you can see more details about that specific agreement as shown above.

If you click on one of the bars, it will take you to the [Agreement Details page](broken-reference) for the corresponding agreement.

Filter options are also available above the chart.

### Savings Analysis <a href="#post-796-_toc14239659" id="post-796-_toc14239659"></a>

Savings Analysis shows you a summary of your savings for all agreements. The savings data displayed will be for the “Start – End” date period defined.

You can reference the “[how to add Savings for Agreements”](broken-reference) section to learn more.

### Products Overview <a href="#post-796-_toc14239660" id="post-796-_toc14239660"></a>

Products Overview shows you the list of all products available in Renewal Manager, no matter which agreements they come from.

Within this list of products you can:

* Use advanced search to narrow down the number of products displayed

### User Role – Read Only Access <a href="#post-796-_toc14180246" id="post-796-_toc14180246"></a>

You have the option to assign “Read Only” user access.

Read only access will let the user see a list of all agreements and related data, but they won’t be able to do any modification.

They won’t be able to do any of the following:

* Add/Edit Agreements
* Add/Edit Products
* Execute bulk actions
* Modify any data

### Grid Customization <a href="#post-796-_toc14180248" id="post-796-_toc14180248"></a>

Each grid available in Renewal Manager can be personalize. Once you click on “Customize” you will see the list of columns which can be added to the grid. Simply click on the check boxes next to the information you would like to view.

If you select multiple columns to display and the view is not wide enough to show all information, you can resize the specific column widths by moving your mouse cursor over the column border and then “click and drag” the column to your required width.

Use the horizontal scroll bar to navigate across.
