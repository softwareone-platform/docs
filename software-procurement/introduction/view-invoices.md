# View Invoices

PyraCloud provides a single view into all the open invoices.

You can filter invoices by country, business unit, cost center and more to develop a clear view on both global and business unit spend.

To access invoices click on “Inventory” in the main PyraCloud navigation bar and select “Invoices”.
