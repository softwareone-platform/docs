# Understanding my 365Simple subscriptions

***

### Viewing your tenant and contract details <a href="#tenant-and-contract-details" id="tenant-and-contract-details"></a>

The My Subscriptions page displays your tenant and contract details along with a list of your current and recently deleted subscriptions and add-ons.

When the My Subscriptions page first loads, your selected tenant and total monthly cost are displayed. Your tenant and contract details are hidden by default.

**To view your tenant and contract details**

1. Select **Tenant & Contract Details**.
2. When the tenant and contract details section is expanded, your Microsoft tenant domain and ID are displayed beside the details of your 365Simple contract.
3. Select **View Contract** to see your 365Simple contract in detail.
4. Select **Tenant & Contract Details** again to hide the details.

### Subscriptions and Add-ons List <a href="#subscriptions-and-add-ons-list" id="subscriptions-and-add-ons-list"></a>

Your 365Simple subscriptions and add-ons are displayed in a single list.

#### Basic Information <a href="#basic-information" id="basic-information"></a>

Each subscription or add-on in the list is displayed with the following information:

* **Product Name**: Name of the product the subscription is for and is displayed in larger bold lettering at the top left of each subscription.
* **Subscription Name**: Friendly name for the subscription.
* **Status**: Current status of the subscription as it stands in your Microsoft tenant. This does not reflect any planned changes in unsubmitted change requests. Subscriptions are either Active, Suspended, or Deleted
* **License Quantity**: Current quantity of the subscription as it stands in your Microsoft tenant. This does not reflect any planned changes in unsubmitted change requests.
* **Monthly Price / Unit**: Current cost per license (or other unit, e.g. GB for extra file storage add-ons).
* **Total Monthly Cost**: Calculated as License Quantity multiplied by Monthly Price / Unit. When a subscription or add-on is in Suspended or Deleted status, the Total Monthly Cost is zero.

#### Chips <a href="#chips" id="chips"></a>

In addition to this information, each subscription or add-on in the list may also show “chips” to provide more information as shown below:

The chips represent the following:

* **Open Change Request**: Indicates that the subscription or add-on has pending changes in a Change Request that has not been submitted yet.
* **Add-on**: Indicates that the subscribed product is an add-on and belongs to a parent subscription.
* **Trial 1/1**: Indicates that the subscription or add-on is a trial. Generally speaking, trials last for 30 days. In some cases, a product can be trialed more than once. The numbers after the trial indicate how many trials have been conducted, and the total number of trials possible.
* **105 days to reactivate**: Indicates the number of days left to reactivate a suspended subscription before it is deleted. When a subscription or add-on is suspended, you have up to 90 days to reactivate it (plus the remaining days in the current billing cycle). When this number reaches zero, the subscription or add-on will be deleted, and all data will be permanently destroyed.
* **Deleted 5 days ago**: Indicates how long ago a suspended subscription was deleted. After a subscription has been deleted for 15 days, the subscription will no longer be shown in the subscription and add-on list in Cloud Subscriptions: Manage.
