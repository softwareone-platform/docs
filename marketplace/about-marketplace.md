# About Marketplace

***

The Client Portal provides a defined catalog of approved software publishers and available license scenarios in nearly 90 countries and over a dozen currencies.

It provides a single platform for you to view, track, and manage all software transactions, orders, quotes, invoices, and contracts. This simplifies software procurement management from demand through to delivery and renewal or retirement.
