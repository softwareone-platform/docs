# Buyers

## About buyers

A buyer refers to any organization or legal entity that procures products or services from SoftwareOne and is issued an invoice for the transaction.&#x20;

The Marketplace Platform shows a list of buyers associated with your account. You can manage these buyers by enabling or disabling them, as well as updating their general information.&#x20;

However, note that only SoftwareOne can add new buyers to your account.

## How to access the Buyers page

Account administrators can access the **Buyers** page by navigating to the main menu of the platform and selecting **Settings** > **Buyers**.&#x20;

From the **Buyers** page, administrators can:

* View a list of buyers mapped to your account. The list displays all buyers, including active, enabled, and disabled.
* Update buyers to reflect any changes to their information, including the buyer logo and contact information.
* Temporarily disable a buyer account and re-enable as needed.
