# Buyers

A buyer refers to any organization or legal entity that procures products or services from SoftwareOne and is issued an invoice for the transaction. To learn more about buyers, see [Key Concepts](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/key-concepts.md).

The Marketplace Platform shows a list of buyers associated with your account. You can manage the buyers through the platform and enable or disable them as necessary.&#x20;

You can also update a buyer's details, but you cannot add new buyers to your account. This can be done by SoftwareOne only.

## How to access the Buyers page

If you are an account administrator, you can access the **Buyers** page by navigating to the main menu and selecting **Settings** > **Buyers**.&#x20;

From the **Buyers** page, administrators can:

* View a list of buyers mapped to your account. The list displays all buyers, including active, enabled, and disabled.
* Update buyers to reflect any changes to their information, including the buyer logo and contact information.
* Temporarily disable a buyer account and re-enable as needed.
