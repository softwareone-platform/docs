## About account

An account enables a company or organization to sign in to the Marketplace Platform and access various platform modules and features. Each account contains users and you can organize those users into groups.

Different types of accounts exist on the Marketplace Platform. To learn more, see [Users, Accounts, and Groups](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/key-concepts.md#portals-accounts-and-users).
