# Licensees

## About licensees

In the context of SoftwareOne, a licensee may represent a specific person within your account or a department that receives the license. To learn about the licensees, see [Key Concepts](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/key-concepts.md).

Once your account is set up, SoftwareOne creates licensees and links them to the buyers and sellers in your account. Your account can contain multiple licensees, however, a licensee can only be linked to one buyer and one seller.&#x20;

## How to access the Licensees page

If you are an account administrator, you can access the **Licensees** page by navigating to the main menu and selecting **Settings** > **Licensees**. Here, you can do the following:

* Create new licensees and map licensees to buyers and sellers.
* View all licensees and their associated details.
* Update the licensee information.
* Disable a license and re-enable it as needed.
