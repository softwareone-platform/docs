# Remove User

In certain situations, you might need to remove a person from your account. If you are an account administrator, you can use the **Remove** option to remove individuals.

Before removing a user, note the following points:

* Ensure that you've reviewed the user's permissions and assigned groups. This is necessary to prevent accidental removal.
* Removing a user doesn't delete them from the system. This allows you to reinvite the user to your account. For more information, see [Add New User](add-new-users.md).
* Removing a user only removes them from the respective account. If the user is associated with several accounts, they'll still be able to access those accounts on the platform.&#x20;
* You cannot remove your own user account.&#x20;

## Remove a user from your account

Follow these steps to remove an individual from your account:

1. On the **Users** page (**Settings** > **Users**), find the user to remove.
2. Click the actions icon (**•••**) for the user and select **Remove**.

A message is displayed stating that the user is removed.&#x20;

After the user is removed, they'll receive an email stating that they've been removed from the account and the associated user groups.&#x20;

Remember that if the user belongs to multiple accounts in the Marketplace Platform, they'll still have access to those accounts.
