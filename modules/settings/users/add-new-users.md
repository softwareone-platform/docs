# Add New Users

As an account administrator, you can invite new users to your Marketplace Platform account. You can also track the invitations you send and resend invitations. Invitations are valid for up to 7 days.&#x20;

Before adding an individual to your account, note the following points:

* Ensure you have the individual's first name, last name, and email address.
* Verify that an account with the same email address doesn't already exist. If an email address already exists, the platform displays a message.
* Make sure you've added the individual to the correct group.

## Add a new user to your account

Follow these steps to add a new member:

1. Navigate to the **Users** page (**Settings** > **Users**).
2. Click **Add**. The **Add user** page opens.&#x20;

3. In the **User details** section, provide the following details and click **Next**:
   * **First name** - (Required) The first name of the individual associated with the account.
   * **Last name** - (Required) The last name of the individual associated with the account.
   * **Email address** - (Required) The email address the individual will use to sign in to the account.&#x20;
   * **Country code** - (Optional) The country code associated with the individual's phone number.
   * **Phone number** - (Optional) The individual's phone number.&#x20;
4. In the **Groups** section, select the groups to add the individual to and click **Next**. You must choose at least one group. If you have several groups, use **Search** to find the group.

5. In the **Overview** section, review the information and click **Add**.&#x20;

After clicking **Add**, the Marketplace Platform sends an invitation email to the user. The email contains a link for them to click and join the account.&#x20;

* The user must accept the invitation within 7 days of receiving the invitation email. Otherwise, the invitation link will expire, and you'll need to regenerate it if you still want the person to join your account.&#x20;
* After the user accepts the invitation and creates their account, they can start using the Marketplace straightway, depending on the modules and features they can access.

{% hint style="info" %}
#### **Didn't receive the invitation email?**

We recommend checking your Spam or Junk folder. If you still haven't received the email, ask your administrator to resend the invite. To learn more, see [Resend an invitation](resend-invitation.md).&#x20;

#### **Received the invitation email but the link has expired?**

Your account administrator will need to generate a new invitation. To learn more, see [Generate a new invitation](generate-new-invitation.md).
