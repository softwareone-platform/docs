# Delete Draft Orders

If you've saved an order as a draft without submitting it, you have the option to delete it.

## Before you begin

Before deleting an order, note the following points:

* You can only delete orders with the **Draft** status. To learn about the various statuses, see [Order States](order-states.md).&#x20;
* Deleted orders cannot be reinstated or edited, but they'll still be displayed in your list of orders.
* When you delete a draft purchase order, the corresponding agreement is also deleted.&#x20;

## Delete a draft order

Follow these steps to delete your draft order:

1. Navigate to the **Orders** page (**Marketplace** > **Orders**). A list of your orders is displayed.
2. Find the order you want to delete and click the order number. The details page of your selected order opens.&#x20;
3. Click the down arrow (next to **Edit**) and then select **Delete**.&#x20;
