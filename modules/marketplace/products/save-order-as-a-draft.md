# Save Order as a Draft

When placing an order, you can save it as a draft with all its details and return to it later to complete it. When you are ready to finalize the order, locate the order on the [Orders](../orders/orders-interface.md) page and complete the remaining steps to place your order.&#x20;

## Save your order as a draft

Follow these steps to save your order as a draft:

1. Navigate to the **Products** page (**Marketplace** > **Products**) and locate the product to buy.
2. Click **Buy Now**. The purchase wizard for your selected product starts.&#x20;
3. Continue through the wizard and complete all sections until you reach the **Order Details** section. Note that a section is enabled only after you've completed the previous step.
4. In the **Order Details** section, click **Save order**.&#x20;

Your order is saved and a confirmation message is displayed. You can open the draft order at any time from the **Orders** page and resume the purchase process.&#x20;

For information on the **Orders** page, see [Orders interface](../orders/orders-interface.md).
