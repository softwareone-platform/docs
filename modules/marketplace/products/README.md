# Products

In the SoftwareOne Marketplace, you can browse and choose from a wide range of subscription-based products from the Microsoft CSP and Adobe VIP Marketplace programs.&#x20;

The **Products** page is the main page that lists all products and lets you start the ordering process. You can buy new products by establishing a new agreement with SoftwareOne, or use your existing agreement:

* **New agreement** - You can set up a new agreement if you are new to SoftwareOne or if your procurement needs differ from your existing contracts.
* **Existing agreement** - You can use an existing agreement to order new products, add new items to an existing agreement, and even adjust the quantity of your current licenses.&#x20;

When ordering a product, the parameters and steps required can vary based on the product and the vendor.  For example, when ordering Microsoft 365, you must choose whether to create a new Microsoft tenant or use your existing account. This step will not apply to Adobe purchases.&#x20;

For an overview of the purchasing process, see [How to buy products in the Marketplace](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/marketplace-for-clients/how-to-buy-products-in-the-marketplace.md). To learn about the **Products** page, see [Products Interface](products-interface.md).
