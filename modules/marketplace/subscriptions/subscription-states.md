# Subscription States

Subscriptions in the Marketplace Platform can be in multiple states (also known as status) during their lifecycle.&#x20;

The following diagram shows the possible states and the transition between these states:

The subscription states are visible in the platform as **Status**. These states are also displayed as an icon beside the name of the subscription and its ID on the details page.
