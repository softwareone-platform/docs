# Terminate Subscription

Subscriptions can be terminated if you no longer need them or don't want them to renew automatically. Depending on the number of subscriptions in your agreement, there are different steps to follow:

* If your agreement contains several subscriptions and you want to cancel some, but not all, subscriptions, you'll need to place a termination order for the subscription.&#x20;
* If your agreement contains several subscriptions and you want to cancel all of those subscriptions, you'll need to place a termination order for the agreement. To learn more, see [Terminate Agreement](../agreements/terminate-agreements.md).&#x20;

## Before you begin

Before terminating a subscription, note the following points:

* You can only terminate subscriptions in the **Active** state. Subscriptions in [any other state](subscription-states.md) cannot be terminated.
* Creating a termination order doesn't guarantee the cancellation of your subscription. All termination orders are sent to the vendors for approval. Subscriptions are terminated only after they are approved by the vendor.
