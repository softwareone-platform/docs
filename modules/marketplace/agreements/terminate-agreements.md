# Terminate Agreement

If you want to terminate your agreement, you can do so by creating a termination order through the platform. Terminating an agreement cancels all subscriptions within that agreement.

Before terminating an agreement, note the following points:

* You can only terminate agreements in the Active state. Agreements in any other state (such as **Processing** or **Updating**) cannot be terminated. For a description of these states, see [Agreements Interface](agreements-interface.md).
* Creating a termination order doesn't immediately cancel your agreement. An agreement is terminated only after the vendor has approved it for termination.

## Terminate an agreement

Follow these steps to terminate your agreement:

1. Navigate to the **Agreements** page (**Marketplace** > **Agreements**). A list of your agreements is displayed.
