# Rename Agreement

If you have several agreements in your account, you can rename those agreements so you can locate them easily in your list of agreements.

Before renaming an agreement, note the following points:

* You can only rename an active agreement. To learn about the different statuses, see [Agreement States](agreement-states.md).
* While renaming the agreement, the new name cannot be blank. If the name is empty or invalid, the platform displays a message.

## Rename an agreement

Follow these steps to update the name of your agreement:

1. Navigate to the **Agreements** page (**Marketplace** > **Agreements**). A list of your agreements is displayed.
