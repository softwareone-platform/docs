# Rename Agreements

If you have several agreements in your account, you can rename those agreements so you can locate them easily.

Before renaming an agreement, note the following points:

* You can only rename an agreement if it's in the **Active** state.
* An agreement name cannot be blank. If the name is empty or invalid, the platform displays a message.

## Rename an agreement

Follow these steps to update the name of your agreement:

1. Navigate to the **Agreements** page (**Marketplace** > **Agreements**). A list of your agreements is displayed.
