The Dashboard page is organized into various sections, comprising filters and a display area for data visualization.

On the dashboard, you can select a date range for your SPLA report and use filter options to control the data you want to visualize. You can filter by currency, agreements, and contracts, and use **Show more options** to select the advanced Report and Product filters. You can also choose if you want to show the total quantity and the Product/Month graph on the dashboard.&#x20;
