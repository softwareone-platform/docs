# Simple for AWS dashboard

The Simple for AWS dashboard provides an overview for customers taking advantage of SoftwareONE’s Simple for AWS service. The dashboard is a single point of access to various sections of the platform. On the dashboard, you can also view your quarterly spend information, support tickets, service recommendations, and articles.

If you have multiple Microsoft tenants, you will see a dropdown next to your tenant name on the Simple for AWS dashboard, allowing you to switch between tenants.

When you switch tenants, the widget values in the dashboard will change accordingly.

As tenants are permission-based, some users may not see all available customer tenants.
