# Recommendations

***

The Recommendations module is a set of functionalities that facilitate intelligent recommendations and suggestions to optimize, streamline, and improve your software environment, be that on-premise or the cloud.

The Recommendations module offers recommendations from a variety of sources, such as Azure Advisor, AWS Cost Explorer, and AWS Trusted Advisor as well as integrating with SoftwareONE Services to provide bespoke and tailored recommendations that optimize a customerâ€™s software environment.

Additionally, the Recommendation module provides capabilities to track metrics such as realized savings and completed recommendations for example, so these can be further used to track, manage, and report on savings opportunities and other key success metrics as well as justify return on investment.
