# View Recommendations

***

The Recommendations module allows you to understand and visualize recommendations in various ways.&#x20;

The Overview page of the module is an analytics-based view that helps you understand how recommendations are associated with various parts of your infrastructure and how they are tracked (potential or completed). All recommendations are divided into three areas:

* Cost Optimization
* Operational Excellence
* Security

The tiles on the Overview page display how recommendations are distributed across different areas, and how advanced you are in implementing them. Additionally, under each tile, you can find information about the most impactful recommendation type.

The Recommendation module collects data from different sources. This information is presented in the grid below the tiles.

### Recommendation Features <a href="#recommendation-features" id="recommendation-features"></a>

The Recommendations module provides recommendations for on-premise and cloud environments. All recommendations come with a set of capabilities offered as part of the Recommendations platform. Some of these are:

* Ability to collaborate with your peers and SoftwareONE services through messaging and mentions.
* Ability to track the progress of every recommendation along with notes at every stage of the recommendation.

#### Messaging <a href="#messaging" id="messaging"></a>

You can collaborate on recommendations by using the messaging features. Simply click on a Recommendation from the grid and then navigate to the Messages tab.

The messaging feature allows stakeholders to participate in a conversation, so multiple collaborators can keep on top of recommendations and their progress. Through the use of the ‘mentions’ feature, users can tag their peers or SoftwareONE Services Consultants to bring items, to-do lists or issues to their attention.

This is available by typing ‘@’ and then typing the user’s first/last name, and selecting their name from the dropdown. When a user is mentioned in a conversation, an email is sent to the mentioned user as a notification. These email notifications cannot be turned off.

#### Progress Log <a href="#progress-log" id="progress-log"></a>

Every recommendation can be tracked through its lifecycle with the progress log functionality. You can track progress by navigating to the progress log.

### Marking a recommendation as complete <a href="#marking-a-recommendation-as-complete" id="marking-a-recommendation-as-complete"></a>

All recommendations can be marked as complete from the Recommendation Type page when completed. There is an option to complete one or all recommendations of the given type.

For Azure and AWS recommendations, you don’t need to Mark recommendations as Complete because the Recommendations system automatically detects when recommendations are being executed and moves them to the completed/realized state. However, there are some exceptions to automatically realizing savings amounts from Azure and AWS Recommendations. For details, see [Completion of Azure Recommendations](working-with-recommendations.md#completion-of-azure-recommendations) and [AWS Recommendations](working-with-recommendations.md#aws-recommendations).

Once a recommendation has been completed, it is moved from the Active tab on the main page to the Realised tab.

### Dismissing a recommendation <a href="#dismissing-a-recommendation" id="dismissing-a-recommendation"></a>

If a recommendation is not planned to be actioned on, you can dismiss the recommendation from the Recommendation type page. There is an option to dismiss all recommendations of the given type.

### SLM Recommendations <a href="#slm-recommendations" id="slm-recommendations"></a>

Software Lifecycle Management (SLM) Recommendations are recommendations that are categorized into the following categories:

* **Savings:** These recommendations when actioned can enable cost savings.
* **Risk:** These recommendations help mitigate compliance risk for licenses that seem to come from a non-compliance position.
