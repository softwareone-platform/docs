# About Spend Management

SoftwareOne's Cloud Managed Services customers can optimize spending across multiple cloud resources through the Client Portal. To manage spending effectively, you can create a customized cloud and spend management solution that caters specifically to your business needs.

#### Cloud Spend Management&#x20;

With Cloud Spend Management, you can view and predict cloud usage across Azure, AWS, and Office 365. You can also tag cloud resources, set budgets, track usage and spending against budgets, and set up chargebacks. You can also create alerts so you are notified if you are nearing certain thresholds, and view recommendations that can identify possible cost savings, performance, and security enhancements.

#### Software Asset Spend Management

With Software Asset Spend Management, you can efficiently oversee and manage your software asset spending across your organization. You can export your software assets to the other Software Asset Management (SAM) tools and import software assets, including those not procured through SoftwareOne.
