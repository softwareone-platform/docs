# Procurement Workbench

***

Procurement Workbench consolidates all features that our procurement users need to manage software transactions.

The procurement page contains all the information associated with quoting, ordering, and tracking your software purchases. If pricing is unavailable, you can use special quotes to request prices.

You can also easily access your frequently purchased items, generate a quote for placing an order, and check the status of your transaction.

Procurement Workbench also allows you to check items that are awaiting approval along with your open and overdue invoices.

For information on how to access this module and use various features, see [View and Manage Software Transactions](view-and-manage-software-transactions.md).
