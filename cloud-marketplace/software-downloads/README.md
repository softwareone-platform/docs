# Software Downloads

The Software Downloads module allows you to download software packages that SoftwareOne provides. You can also use this module to upload your files and packages to the cloud storage, add metadata for the files (for example, bundle several files into a package, provide a file name, define the publisher/version, and so on), and distribute those packages.

**NOTE**: Uploading software packages or files is a paid feature. If you don't see the **Upload** tab in the Software Download module, contact your SoftwareOne representative.
