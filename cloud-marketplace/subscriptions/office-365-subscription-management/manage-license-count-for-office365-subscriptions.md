### Update Your Subscriptions <a href="#update-your-subscriptions" id="update-your-subscriptions"></a>

Subscription Manager supports storing several changes and applying them all together as a single order.

As you adjust subscriptions and add-ons in Subscription Manager, your changes are stored as a “draft”. A “draft” represents a set of changes to one or more subscriptions or add-ons in your tenant.

Once you are happy with your changes, you can then apply them immediately, or send them for approval by another user in your organization.

* Then scroll down and adjust the quantity in the Adjustments section of the page.

#### Adjust Subscription Status <a href="#adjust-subscription-status" id="adjust-subscription-status"></a>

You can adjust the status of your subscriptions on the Subscription Detail page.

To do this, click the View link in the Actions column on the Subscriptions tab. Then adjust the status in the Subscription Status section of the page.

**Important:** You can only adjust the status of subscriptions if you have been granted the “Can Suspend” permission in Subscription Manager. If you require this permission, please contact your account team.

#### Apply Your Changes Immediately <a href="#apply-your-changes-immediately" id="apply-your-changes-immediately"></a>

Once you have made all the required adjustments, navigate back to the main subscriptions tab by clicking the Back to Subscription Manager button at the bottom of any page.

Below the grid, you can see the cost impact of the changes you have made.

* The **Current Monthly Total** shows the total monthly cost of your subscriptions and add-ons prior to applying your changes
* The **New Monthly Total** shows the total monthly cost of your subscriptions and add-ons after applying your changes
* The **Difference** shows the change in monthly cost as a result of applying your changes.

There are two ways to apply your changes depending on the permissions you have been granted:

1. **Apply Now**: If you have been granted the “Apply Now” permission, you can apply your changes straight away. These changes will take effect immediately, and your new licenses will be available to assign to users within a few minutes.
2. **Send for Approval**: If you have been granted the “Send for Approval” permission, you can select another user in your organization who has the “Apply Now” permission to apply your changes for you

***

#### Apply Now <a href="#apply-now" id="apply-now"></a>

If you have the Apply Now permission and you have made changes to your subscriptions and/or add-ons, then the Apply Now button at the bottom of the screen will be enabled.

Click Apply Now to apply your changes.

When you click Apply Now, a progress bar will be displayed above the grid showing the progress of the operation. Once it is complete, you will be able to assign those new licenses to users in the Office 365 admin portal.

**Important**: While your changes are being applied, you will not be able to make further changes to your subscriptions. Please wait until the process is complete before continuing to make new changes.
