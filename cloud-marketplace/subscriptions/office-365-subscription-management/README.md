# Office 365 Subscription Management

***

The Cloud Spend Management allows you to tag cloud resources, set budgets and track usage and spend against budgets, split shared cloud resources, and set up chargebacks so you can distribute the cost of consumption to the departments driving usage. You can also set up alerts so you are notified if you are close to certain thresholds, and we also provide recommendations that can identify possible cost savings as well as performance and security enhancements.

### Managing your Office 365 subscriptions

Depending on your level of subscription, you can gain visibility into your Office 365 (O365) subscriptions, track usage, view assigned and unassigned licenses, and manage subscription allocations.

We provide 3 tiers of analytics based on your level of support:

| Support level                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
