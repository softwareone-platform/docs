# Working with purchase approval groups

***

### What are approval groups?

Workflows and approval groups allow you to simplify the configuration and maintenance of approval limits. Approval groups represent a set of individuals who can approve the orders. Approval groups are assigned to users.

The purpose of approval groups is to create a collection of users who are responsible for approvals. To reduce the effort of maintaining a group, you can link approval groups together through parent-child relationships.

Each approval group can only have one parent but can be used as the child in many approval groups.

**NOTE**: Only administrators can the Purchase Approval Workflows. If any other user requires access, either the administrator can set it up or the user can contact their SoftwareOne representative.

### Creating an approval group

You can create up to 3 levels of purchase approval groups.

**To create an approval group**

1. From the main navigation menu, navigate to **Setup** and select **Purchase Approval Setup**.
2. Select **New Group**. The Create Approval Group window opens.
3. Provide a name for your approval group, select the approval level, and log in from the list.
4. Select **Create** to create the approval group.

If an order created by the user exceeds the allowed spending limit, the individuals in the approval group will be listed as valid approvers. These approval groups can be linked together by creating parent-child relationships.
