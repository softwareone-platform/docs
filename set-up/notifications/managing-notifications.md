# Managing notifications

The Notification Hub is a centralized place to view and manage notifications. There are two types of notifications:&#x20;

* **System notifications**: These notifications are associated with your profile. You cannot subscribe or unsubscribe from these notifications.
* **User notifications**: These notifications are also called feature notifications. These notifications are sent only if you are subscribed to receive them.

***
