# Managing notifications

The Notification Hub is a centralized place where you can view and manage your system and user notifications.

* **System notifications:** These notifications are usually associated with your profile. You cannot subscribe or unsubscribe from these notifications.
* **User notifications:** These are the feature notifications that are sent only if you've subscribed to them.

By default, all notifications are erased after 30 days, regardless of whether they have been read or not.

### Accessing the Notifications Hub

**To access the Notifications Hub**

* From the main menu, navigate to **Setup** and select **Notifications**. The Notifications page opens.
