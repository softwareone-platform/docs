# My 365 Analytics report doesn't contain any data

***

If your report is empty and you receive this message as you are building a report 'There is no data for this chart, there are a few reasons for this, including:

* The data is being filtered in a way that no data is returning. You may need to edit your report and modify the filters that you have applied.
* The data may require access to the Security and Audit Logs that may not have been configured. Check your 365 Analytics settings.
* The data has not been collected as the data collection needs to be authorized.
* You may need to reauthorize your tenant**.** For information, see [How to connect your 365 Tenant for data collection](how-to-connect-your-365-tenant-for-data-collection.md).

If you've completed these steps and still have the notification or the report is still empty, contact our Support team.&#x20;
