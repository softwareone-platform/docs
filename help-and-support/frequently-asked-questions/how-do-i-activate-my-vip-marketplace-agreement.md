# How do I activate my VIP Marketplace agreement?

If your Adobe VIP subscriptions have been migrated to the Adobe VIP Marketplace program, and your SoftwareOne representative has created a draft purchase order, you’ll need to accept the terms of the new buying program by completing your draft order.

After completing the order, your VIP Marketplace agreement will become active. You’ll then be able to view your agreement, make new purchases, and self-manage your subscriptions in the Marketplace Platform.

To complete your draft purchase order, follow these steps:

1. Do one of the following:
   * Click the link you received in the email from SoftwareOne. If you are signed in to your account, you'll be redirected to the details page of your draft order.&#x20;
   * Navigate to the [Orders](../../platform-modules/marketplace/orders/) page (**Marketplace** > **Orders**) and click the Adobe order in the **Draft** state. The details page of the draft order opens.&#x20;
2. Select the **Items** tab and click **Edit**.&#x20;

3. Review the item details, including quantity and prices, and click **Next**.&#x20;

You cannot add new items or change the quantity of existing items within a draft purchase order. Items can be added or updated only after you've accepted the terms and activated your agreement.
{% endhint %}

4. In the **Order details** section, update the agreement name and provide other details as necessary. Click **Next**.
