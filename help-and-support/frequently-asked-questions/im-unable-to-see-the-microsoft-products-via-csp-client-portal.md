# I'm unable to see the Microsoft products via CSP/Client Portal

***

SoftwareOne is unable to sell products that Microsoft is no longer making available for sale through partners.

Microsoft occasionally pulls products from its CSP catalog and therefore, SoftwareOne can no longer sell it.

Microsoft adjusts the partner catalog every month. They add, update, and remove products and pricing to align with global markets and other factors.

In some cases, free products can still be found directly on Microsoft, and you can purchase these products directly from Microsoft.
