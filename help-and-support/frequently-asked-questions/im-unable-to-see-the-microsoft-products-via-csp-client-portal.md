# I'm unable to see the Microsoft products via CSP/Client Portal

SoftwareOne can't sell products that Microsoft is no longer making available for sale through partners.&#x20;

Microsoft adjusts the partner catalog monthly to add, update, and remove products and change pricing to align with global markets and other factors.

In some cases, free products can still be found directly on Microsoft, and you can purchase these products directly from Microsoft.
