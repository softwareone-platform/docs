# I'm unable to grant permissions via User Management

If you're unable to provide access to a selected feature or select a specific role through the User Management module, it might be because of the following reasons:

* You have no Procurement Permissions set up. To resolve this issue, request Procurement Permissions. The feature will become available after these permissions are provided.
* The roles are read-only. To resolve this issue, contact our Support team because there might be an issue with the legacy access configuration.
