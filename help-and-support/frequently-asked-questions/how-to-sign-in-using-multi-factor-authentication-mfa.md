# How to sign in using Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**: If you have a new mobile phone and want to set up MFA for your login again, please [Contact Support](../getting-support.md). After we reset your MFA, you can scan a new QR code with your new phone. Please make sure to use the email address that matches your Client Portal username.
{% endhint %}

## **Prerequisites**

To set up MFA, you'll require the following:

1. A mobile phone with an Android or iOS operating system.
2. Your username and password for the Client Portal.
3. An Authenticator app. You can use any Authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator.

### **Installing the Authenticator App**

In this example, we've used Google Authenticator, but the steps are the same for any Authenticator app.

1. Download the Google Authenticator app from the Google Play store.
2. Open the Authenticator app and choose **Scan a QR code.**

3. Point the camera of your mobile phone to the QR code on the Client Portal page and wait for the scanned data to be added to your Authenticator app.

### **Use an existing Authenticator app**

If you already have an Authenticator app installed on your phone, perform these steps:

1\. Open the app and tap on the **Plus** sign in the bottom right corner.&#x20;

2. Choose **Scan QR Code**.&#x20;
3. Point the camera of your phone to the QR code on the Client Portal and wait for the scanned data to be added to your Authenticator app.

### **Manual setup without QR code**

If you have problems scanning the QR Code,&#x20;

1. Select **Trouble Scanning?** on the login page:

2. Write down or copy the one-time code:

3. Tap on **Enter a setup key** in your Authenticator app and provide your account name, secret code, and choose your preferred time criteria.

## Completing the MFA setup

After you successfully perform the above steps, your Client Portal account will be on a list similar to the following image. Each account is shown in a separate row. The six-digit code is the OTP code you will need to enter on the login page when you are asked for your one-time code.

1. Enter the OTP code on the login screen and click **Continue.**

2. Copy the recovery code and store it in a secure place. You can use the recovery code to sign in to the Client Portal when you don't have access to the Authenticator app on your mobile phone.

After your successful setup and initial login, you can use the Client Portal.

## Signing in using MFA

### Signing in with an OTP

After setup, enter the OTP code from your Authenticator app to sign-in page.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**: The Authenticator app shows the duration the OTP code will be valid for (maximum of 30 seconds). Enter the OTP code in time for a successful login. If there are only a few seconds left, we recommend to wait for the code to refresh.
{% endhint %}

### Signing in with a recovery code

If you don't have access to your Authenticator app, you can also sign in using your one-time recovery code. When you are asked for the OTP code, select **Try another method** and then **Recovery code**.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (15) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="364"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

On the next screen, enter your recovery code to sign in:&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**: When you sign in using your recovery code, you will get another one-time recovery code. Make sure to store this code securely for your next login without your Authenticator app.
