# How to sign in using Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a new mobile phone and want to set up MFA for your PyraCloud login again, please contact PyraCloud support. After we reset your MFA, you can scan a new QR code with your new phone. Please make sure to use the e-mail address that matches your PyraCloud username.
{% endhint %}

### Setup Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Follow these steps to setup Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for PyraCloud.

#### **Prerequisites**

#### Setup Authenticator App

**Install Authenticator App**

If you do not have an Authenticator app installed on your mobile phone yet, install one first. You can use any generic Authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator. We use Google Authenticator as an example. The steps are very similar for any other Authenticator app.

Open the Authenticator app and choose “Scan a QR code” as shown below**.**

Point the camera of your mobile phone to the QR code on the PyraCloud page and wait for the scanned data to be added to your Authenticator app.

**Use Existing Authenticator App**

If you already have an Authenticator app installed, open it and tap on the “Plus” sign in the bottom right corner (as shown below). Then choose “Scan QR Code”. Once done, point the camera of your mobile phone to the QR code on the PyraCloud page and wait for the scanned data to be added to your Authenticator app.

**Manual Setup Without QR Code**

If you have problems to scan the QR Code, click on the “Trouble scanning?” option on the PyraCloud page and write down or copy the presented code as shown below.

Tap on “Enter a setup key” in your Authenticator app and provide your account name, secret code and choose your preferred time criteria.

#### Complete PyraCloud MFA Setup

After you successfully performed the above mentioned steps, your PyraCloud account will be on a list similar to this one:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Each account is shown in a separate row. The six digit code is the OTP code you will need to enter on the PyraCloud login page when you are asked for your one-time code.

Next, enter the OTP code on the PyraCloud login screen and click "Continue":

Copy the recovery code and store it in a secure place. You can use the recovery code to login to PyraCloud when you do not have access to the Authenticator app on your mobile phone.

After your successful setup and initial login, you can use PyraCloud.

### Login Using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

#### Login With an OTP Code

After your successful setup, enter the OTP code from your Authenticator app to login to PyraCloud with Multi-factor authentication.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
The Authenticator app shows how long the OTP code will be valid (maximum of 30 seconds). Enter the OTP code in time for a successful login. If there are only a few seconds left, we recommend to wait for the code to refresh.
{% endhint %}

#### Login With a Recovery Code

If you do not have access to your Authenticator app, you can also login to PyraCloud using your one-time recovery code. When you are asked for the OTP code, click on “Try another method” and then on “Recovery code”. On the next screen, enter your recovery code to login to PyraCloud.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you login using your recovery code, you will get another one-time recovery code. Make sure to store this code securely for your next login without your Authenticator app.
