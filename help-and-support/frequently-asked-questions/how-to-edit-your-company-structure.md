# How to edit your company structure

This feature is currently available to most PyraCloud customers. If you cannot manage the company structure on your own yet, then SoftwareOne will need to migrate your company structure first.

### Introduction <a href="#post-4917-_ref61592726" id="post-4917-_ref61592726"></a>

The purpose of the company structure is to grant procurement users access to a set of companies. Procurement users use PyraCloud to purchase from SoftwareONE. If you change the company structure, this can have an impact on the companies that your users can purchase through.

A company structure that is used to grant procurement access can be different from your legal company structure (or any other structure you use internally).

### Why do I already have a Company Structure? <a href="#post-4917-_toc63257167" id="post-4917-_toc63257167"></a>

SoftwareONE automatically generates a company structure for a customer’s PyraCloud tenant. Each company is created in a separate sub-folder below your top-level folder. Therefore, each company is on the same level.

If this automatically generated company structure works (e.g., if only a small number of companies are present), then the company structure can be used as is.

If a more hierarchical company structure is needed, the “Company Structure” editor can be used in PyraCloud to make changes to the company structure. This is described in detail in the following sections of this document.

**Note:** A company structure is set up during the PyraCloud onboarding process. The “Company Structure” editor can only be used following the migration of your company structure by SoftwareONE.

### Accessing the Company Structure Editor <a href="#post-4917-_toc63257168" id="post-4917-_toc63257168"></a>

The Company Structure Editor can only be accessed by users who have admin privileges. Admin privileges are set up for specified users during the PyraCloud onboarding process.

In order to access the Company Structure Editor, click on the “**Company Structure**” menu item under the user account (top right corner)



_**Figure 1 – Access Company Structure Editor**_

From here the company structure can be viewed. Click on “**Edit Company Structure**” to make changes to the structure:

### Company Structure Editor <a href="#post-4917-_toc63257169" id="post-4917-_toc63257169"></a>

The Company Structure Editor consists of the following:

1. **Introduction** text provides a short overview (see “[Introduction](broken-reference)” for more details)
2. **Company Structure** displays the company structure
3. **Unassigned Companies** displays any companies which are not included in the company structure yet.

Company Structure and “Unassigned Companies” can be searched independently from each other.

### Add an Unassigned Company to the Company Structure <a href="#post-4917-_ref61593747" id="post-4917-_ref61593747"></a>

The Company Structure Editor contains a ‘drag and drop’ feature, which allows you to drag companies from the “Unassigned Companies” panel into the company structure. Companies can also be moved around within the structure by using this drag and drop feature. There are two ways that a company can be dropped into the structure.

|           | **Option 1 (Recommended)**                                                                                                                                                                 | **Option 2**                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Action    | Drop a company **below** an existing folder                                                                                                                                                | Drop a company **into** an existing folder                                                                                                                                  |
| Behavior  | The company will be added to a **new sub-folder**. The sub-folder will be created automatically and will have the name and address of the company. If required, you can rename the folder. | The company will be **added to the existing folder.**                                                                                                                       |
| Advantage | You can give your users **fine-granular access** to your companies.                                                                                                                        | You can **create a simpler company structure** with less folders.                                                                                                           |
| Example   | If you use separate sub-folders for all your US companies, then you can grant your users access to specific US companies.                                                                  | If you use 1 folder for the “United States” and you place all your US companies into that folder, then you can grant your users access either to all or to no US companies. |

For option 1, drag a company and drop it below a folder:

_**Figure 7 – Result when dropping a company into an existing folder**_

**Hint:** Folders and companies can also be dragged and dropped within the company structure (see Figure 8 below), e.g. to move an existing sub-folder from one folder to another.\


<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (29).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_**Figure 8 – Drag and drop in “Company Structure”**_

**Hint:** Folders and companies can also be dragged and dropped into the company structure when the search is active (see Figure 9 below). This can be useful for large company structures

### Remove an Existing Sub-Folder <a href="#post-4917-_toc63257175" id="post-4917-_toc63257175"></a>

If an existing sub-folder with companies is removed, then all companies are moved to “Unassigned Companies”. The companies must be added to the company structure again before you can grant your users access to the companies.

If you have users with access to those companies, then those users will lose their access to those companies. If you have granted your users access to folders with “future companies”, then users will get access to those companies as soon as you add the companies to such folders in your company structure again.

**Note:** You cannot remove the top-level folder.

To remove a folder:

* Click on “Remove” in the context menu of that folder
* If required, confirm removal by clicking on the confirmation checkbox and clicking on “Remove”

**Note:** If you need the list of users to grant them access again, you can copy them from the confirmation message (using the “Copy to clipboard” icon).

### Remove all Companies from a Folder <a href="#post-4917-_toc63257176" id="post-4917-_toc63257176"></a>

If all companies are removed from a folder, then the companies are moved to “Unassigned Companies”. The companies must be added to the company structure again before you can grant your users access to the companies.

If users have access to these removed companies, then those users will lose their access to these companies.

When creating users, it is possible to grant them access to any companies that will be added to a folder in the future as well. As soon as removed companies are added to such folders in your company structure again, then these users will get access to those companies.

To remove all companies from a folder

* Click on “Remove all companies” in the context menu of that folder
* If required, confirm removal by clicking on the confirmation checkbox and clicking on “Remove”

_Note: If you need the list of users to grant them access again, you can copy them from the confirmation message (using the “Copy to clipboard” icon_).

### Remove One Company from a Folder <a href="#post-4917-_toc63257177" id="post-4917-_toc63257177"></a>

If a company is removed from a folder, then the company is moved to “Unassigned Companies”. The companies must be added to the company structure again before you can grant your users access to the companies.

If users have access to the removed company, then those users will lose their access to the company.

When creating users, it is possible to grant them access to any companies that will be added to a folder in the future as well. As soon as removed companies are added to such folders in your company structure again, then these users will get access to those companies.

To remove one company from a folder:

* If required, expand the folder (see [Expand and Collapse Folders](broken-reference))
* Click on “Remove” for the company you want to remove
* If required, confirm removal by clicking on the confirmation checkbox and clicking on “Remove”

**Note:** If you need the list of users to grant them access again, you can copy them from the confirmation message (using the “Copy to clipboard” icon).

### Manage how new companies are added to your Company Structure (auto-add options) <a href="#post-4917-_toc63257178" id="post-4917-_toc63257178"></a>

If there are companies missing in the “Company Structure” editor, then please contact SoftwareONE. SoftwareONE will add these companies to our systems.

PyraCloud offers different ways to add new companies to the company structure:

| **Option**                                                                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Add new companies to separate sub-folders below a selected folder (Recommended) | <p>This option will add new companies automatically to a company structure. By using separate sub-folders, <strong>PyraCloud users can be granted fine granular access to companies</strong>. More details can be found in the section “Add an Unassigned Company to the Company Structure”.<br>This is the default behavior and the preselected folder is the top level folder.</p> |
| 2. Add new companies to an existing folder                                         | This option will add new companies automatically to a company structure. By using an existing folder, **PyraCloud users cannot be granted fine granular access to the companies** in the selected folders.

| 3. Add new companies to “Unassigned Companies”                                     | This option will **not** add new companies automatically to a company structure. You will need to add these companies manually before you can grant PyraCloud users access to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

**1. Add new companies to separate sub-folders below a selected folder (Recommended)**

### Adding more hierarchy to the Company Structure <a href="#post-4917-_toc63257180" id="post-4917-_toc63257180"></a>

Using additional levels for larger company structures allows to grant users access to companies faster.

**Example**: If there are several companies in a country and users should get access to all of them, then it is possible to:

* Grant access by clicking each company separately or
* Use a country folder, add all companies below or to the country folder and grant access to the country folder with one click.

To add more hierarchy:

1. Go to the top level folder of the company structure. In the example below, the top-level folder is “Adastraflex Inc. (Global Headquarters)”.
2. Create a sub-folder for each country by clicking on “New Sub-Folder” in the context menu. In the example below, the sub-folder is named “United States”.
3. Drag and drop all companies below their corresponding country folder. In the example below, the companies are “AdAstraflex Dallas”, “AdAstraflex Houston” and “AdAstraflex Las Vegas”

**Note:** Ensure to drop the existing folders right below the created country folders like “United States” (instead of any other sub-folder for a company).

**Note**: Of course, you can also drop the existing companies into the country folders. Then the company structure becomes simpler but users cannot get fine granular access to separate companies (as described in chapter “Add an Unassigned Company to the Company Structure”). In this case, also delete the remaining folders for the companies.
