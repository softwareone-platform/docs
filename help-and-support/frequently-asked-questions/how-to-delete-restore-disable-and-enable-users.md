# How to delete, restore, disable, and enable users

The “delete and restore users” functionality is available for all customers with access to the new version of User Management.

If users do not need their PyraCloud access anymore (e.g. because they left the company), there are the following 2 options to revoke their access:

1. Delete the user
2. Disable the user

Choose to delete users if this is permanent and disable users if they might need to get access to PyraCloud in the future again (e.g. after coming back from a parental leave).

### Delete Users <a href="#delete-users" id="delete-users"></a>

Users can be deleted from the list of users and from the user details.

#### Delete Users From the List of Users <a href="#delete-users-from-the-list-of-users" id="delete-users-from-the-list-of-users"></a>

Find the user to be deleted on the list of users. If you use the search, make sure to search in the list of active and / or disabled users. Click on “Delete” of the user to be deleted and confirm the user deletion.

Deleted users are shown on the list of deleted users and can be restored from there within 30 days after being deleted.

#### Special Case: Restore Users From Add Users <a href="#special-case-restore-users-from-add-users" id="special-case-restore-users-from-add-users"></a>

Deleted users can also be restored if a User Management administrator tries to add a new user with the same username as a deleted user that can be restored. In this case there are the following 2 options:

1. Restore the user
2. Create a new user

Restore users to bring them back with all of their permissions and settings. This will not create a new user.

Create a new user to specify their permissions and settings. When the deleted user with the same username is to be restored, the User Management administrator needs to specify another username.
