**NOTES**:&#x20;

* The link is valid for 1 day and can only be used once. If you don't reset your password within 1 day of receiving the password reset email, you'll need to regenerate the link. If you requested the password reset link multiple times, only the link in the most recent email will be valid.
* Your new password must be unique and contain at least 8 characters. It must be a combination of lower case letters (a-z), upper case letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and special characters (e.g. ! @ # $ % ^ & \*).
