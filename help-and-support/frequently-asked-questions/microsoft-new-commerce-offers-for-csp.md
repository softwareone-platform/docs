# Microsoft New Commerce Offers for CSP

***

Microsoft has recently released New Commerce offers for seat-based offers including Microsoft 365, Dynamic 365, Power Platform, and Windows 365.

These offer types have now become mandatory for all new subscription purchases. Customers will now need to select between one of the following two subscription term options when purchasing a new subscription:

* **Annual Term Subscriptions** offer a 12-month commitment at a reduced price with the option for upfront or monthly billing frequency
* **Monthly Term Subscriptions** offer a true month-to-month commitment that can be canceled at any time.

We recommend you familiarize yourself with these changes before making any new purchases.
