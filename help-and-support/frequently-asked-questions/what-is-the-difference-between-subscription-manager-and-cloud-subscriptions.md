# What is the difference between subscription manager and cloud subscriptions?

***

We initially developed Subscription Manager to help you to manage your existing license quantities for your Office 365 Subscriptions.

We wanted to enhance this functionality so users could also buy new subscriptions, so we developed the new Cloud Subscriptions experience.

You can now use the new Cloud Subscription features in PyraCloud to search for and buy new services, manage subscription status, and seat counts, and review your order history.

Cloud Subscription is comprised of three modules:

* **Marketplace**: Use **Marketplace** to purchase new subscriptions or add-ons in your existing 365Simple tenant
* **My Subscriptions**: Use **My Subscriptions** to adjust the license quantity and/or status of your existing 365Simple subscriptions
* **Billing**: Use **Billing** to view the history of your purchases and adjustments.

The following table outlines the enhanced functionality that you now receive with Cloud Subscriptions:
