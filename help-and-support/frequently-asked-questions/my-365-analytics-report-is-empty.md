# My 365 Analytics report is empty

If your report is empty and you receive this message _There is no data for this chart_, there are a few reasons for this, including:

* The data is being filtered in a way that no data is returning. You might need to edit your report and modify the filters.
* The data might require access to the Security and Audit Logs that may not have been configured. Check your 365 Analytics settings.
* The data has not been collected as the data collection needs to be authorized.
* You may need to reauthorize your tenant**.** For information, see [How to connect your 365 Tenant for data collection](how-do-i-connect-the-microsoft-tenant-for-data-collection.md).

If you've completed these steps and still have the notification or the report is empty, contact our Support team.&#x20;
