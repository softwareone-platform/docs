# What has changed in the new 365 Analytics?

We've made a number of enhancements to 365 Analytics to provide you with more visibility and control of your Microsoft 365 environment.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**: Our legacy 365 Analytics experience (Cloud Insider) is migrated as of 31 July 2022. As a result, any custom reports and report schedules will not migrate and must be recreated if an available report does not apply.
{% endhint %}

The following table lists the reporting changes.
