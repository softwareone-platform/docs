If your organization already uses the SoftwareOne Marketplace Platform, ask your account administrator to invite you to the account. For detailed instructions, see [Add New Users](../modules-and-features/settings/users/add-new-users.md).&#x20;

If your organization does not yet use the platform, [contact us](https://www.softwareone.com/en/contact-us) to get started.

After you get access, go to [https://portal.platform.softwareone.com](https://portal.platform.softwareone.com) and enter your sign-in credentials.&#x20;

To familiarize yourself with the platform, see [Platform Interface](../marketplace-platform/platform-overview/interface/). For an overview of key concepts and guidance on how to begin using the platform, see the [Getting Started](../marketplace-platform/getting-started/) section.&#x20;
