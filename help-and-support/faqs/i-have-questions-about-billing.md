# I have questions about billing

This page contains frequently asked questions about your invoices and statements.&#x20;

### How do I display a purchase order number on the invoice?&#x20;

You can include a purchase order number by entering it in the **Additional ID** field, located on the **Details** tab within the agreement details page. For more information, see [How can I enter a purchase order number?](how-do-you-handle-purchase-order-numbers-in-subscription-based-models.md#client-guidance-on-po-numbers-and-invoices) and [Update Additional Client ID](../../modules-and-features/marketplace/agreements/edit-agreement-id.md).

### Can I view or download my statements?

Yes, you can view or download your billing statements from the **Attachments** tab on the agreement details page. For more information, see [View and Download Statements](../../modules-and-features/marketplace/billing/statements/download-statements.md).

### Why are all the subscription invoice lines marked as 'Qty 1'?

Vendors generate hundreds or thousands of charges during a billing period, and all charges can't be listed individually on the invoice PDF.&#x20;

To avoid clutter, we consolidate all charges at the item level and display the quantity as '1' on the invoice. You can view the quantity data and the full set of charges in your [billing statement](../../modules-and-features/marketplace/billing/#whats-a-statement). These charges are also displayed on the **Charges** tab within the [statement details page](../../modules-and-features/marketplace/billing/statements.md#subscription-details).

### Why does my invoice show a price different from the price on the Orders page?

The disparity in pricing is due to how proration is calculated.

Proration and invoicing rules are different for every vendor. For instance, under the legacy Adobe VIP program, proration was calculated monthly, making it simpler to provide accurate quotes. However, under the new Adobe VIP Marketplace program, proration is calculated daily. This means that if a quote is issued today and an order is placed after two days, the quote might not align with the final invoice. Additionally, if the order is placed today but processed tomorrow, this can also result in differences.

Therefore, we only display monthly and yearly pricing in the Marketplace.
