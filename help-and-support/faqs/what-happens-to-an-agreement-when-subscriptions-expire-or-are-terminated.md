# What happens to an agreement when subscriptions expire or are terminated?

When you terminate the last active subscription in an agreement or when subscriptions expire, the agreement status changes to **Terminated**. This termination is irreversibl&#x65;_._&#x20;

It means you can no longer use the terminated agreement for ordering new subscriptions and must either set up a new agreement when placing the order or use an existing agreement in the **Active** state to attribute new subscriptions to that agreement.
