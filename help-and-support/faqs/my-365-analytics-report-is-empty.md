# My 365 Analytics report is empty

If your report is empty and you receive the '_There is no data for this chart'_ message, there are a few reasons for this, including:

* The data is being filtered in a way that no data is returning. You might need to edit your report and modify the filters.
* The data might require access to the Security and Audit Logs that may not have been configured. Check your 365 Analytics settings.
* The data has not been collected as the data collection needs to be authorized.
* You may need to reauthorize your tenan&#x74;**.** For information, see [How do I connect the Microsoft tenant for data collection](how-do-i-connect-the-microsoft-tenant-for-data-collection.md)?

If you have completed these steps and still have the notification, or the report is empty, [contact support ](../contact-support.md)for assistance.
