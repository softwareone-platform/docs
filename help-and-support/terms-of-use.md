If your Company does not have a Contract with SoftwareOne, then your Company does not have a license to the Services.

Any such refund will be paid within forty-five (45) days of SoftwareOne’s notice of termination.

## 6. Confidentiality

**Confidential Information.** **“Confidential Information”** means non-public information of a competitive or commercially sensitive, proprietary, financial, or trade secret nature, or information that involves or implicates privacy interests. Confidential Information includes any information labeled “Confidential” or “Proprietary”, business plans, strategies, forecasts, analyses, financial information, employee information, technology information, trade secrets, products, technical data, specifications, documentation, rules and procedures, methods, contracts, presentations, know-how, product plans, business methods, product functionality, data, customers, markets, competitive analysis, databases, formats, methodologies, applications, developments, inventions, processes, payment, delivery and inspection procedures, designs, drawings, algorithms, formulas or information relating to engineering, marketing, or finance and any other information that the Recipient should reasonably believe to be confidential given the circumstances.

SOFTWAREONE’S MAXIMUM TOTAL LIABILITY TO COMPANY FOR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE EQUAL TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY COMPANY DURING TWELVE MONTHS LEADING UP TO ANY CLAIM.

## 13. Relationship of the Parties

The parties are independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement creates any partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, or employment relationship between Company, and SoftwareOne. Company has no authority to make or accept any offers or representations on SoftwareOne’s behalf.

## 14. Disputes

In case of any controversy or dispute, SoftwareOne and Company shall discuss the matter in controversy or dispute and make a diligent effort to find an amicable solution. If an amicable solution is not reached, all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its validity will be finally resolved by the courts of the state/country in which the offices of the SoftwareOne affiliate entering into the Contract are located. The United Nations Convention on the International Sales of Goods will not apply to these Terms or any Contract. SoftwareOne may obtain injunctive or other relief in any state, federal or national court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or alleged infringement of its intellectual property or proprietary rights. The Services are of a special, unique and extraordinary character which gives them a particular value to SoftwareOne that cannot be readily estimated and may not be adequately compensated for in monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in additional to all other remedies available at law or in equity, SoftwareOne will be entitled injunctive or equitable relief if Company breaches this Agreement.

## **16.** Service Up-Time

SoftwareOne aims to make the Marketplace Platform available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Our target is to provide at least **99.5% uptime**. This means the platform should be accessible and working as expected for at least 99.5% of the time.

The target also does not cover downtime caused by events outside our control, such as natural disasters, Internet outages, government actions, or attacks against our systems. It also does not include problems caused by incorrect use, unsupported setups, or issues resulting from actions or inactions by you or anyone using your account.

This Agreement, together with the Contract and any other agreements for additional services accepted within the Interface, represent the entire agreement of the parties regarding the subject matter hereof. SoftwareOne’s failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not act as a waiver to enforce the same or any other provision in the future.
