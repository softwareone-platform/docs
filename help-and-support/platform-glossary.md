# Platform Glossary

* **Agreement** - A formalized record that establishes the terms and conditions under which transactions occur. An agreement details the relationship between the Seller, Buyer, and Licensee, and serves as the foundation for placing orders and creating subscriptions in the platform.&#x20;
* **Buyer** - An entity that engages in commercial activities with SoftwareOne sellers. Buyers are the recipients of invoices issued by SoftwareOne, and they are central to the creation and context of orders, agreements, and subscriptions.
* **Group** - A collection of permissions assembled to streamline the assignment process. Groups facilitate the management of user rights by bundling related permissions, which can then be applied to users collectively, simplifying the administration of access levels across the platform.
* **Item** - An individual unit associated with a specific product, utilized within orders or subscriptions to detail what is being purchased or subscribed to.
* **Licensee** - An entity that utilizes or consumes the services provided by the marketplace. It serves as a critical component in forming Agreements alongside Buyers and Sellers, thereby establishing the complete context of business transactions.
* **Order** - An object that signifies a business transaction under the framework of an established agreement. The platform accommodates a variety of order types, distinguishing between new purchases, change orders, and other transactional categories, each tailored to support different commercial operations and customer needs.
* **Permission** - An access control attribute that can be allocated within the context of a specific account. Permissions specify the exact actions a user or token is authorized to perform, ensuring precise and secure management of the platform's capabilities.
