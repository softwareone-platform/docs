# Planned Maintenance

Planned maintenance is a crucial part of managing and operating the SoftwareOne Marketplace Platform. This topic explains what planned maintenance is, why it is important, and how it affects both vendors and clients using our platform.

## What is planned maintenance?

Planned maintenance refers to scheduled activities aimed at improving the platform's performance, security, and reliability. These activities include software updates, security patches, infrastructure upgrades, and data cleaning. By scheduling these tasks, we ensure that disruptions are kept to a minimum and that the platform remains in optimal condition.

The Marketplace Platform gets **several planned major updates each year** to keep it running well and secure. Usually, there are about **2-3 updates each year**, so you can expect one every **4-6 months**. These updates bring new features, important fixes, and improvements. For a list of past updates and more details, see the [Release Notes](release-notes/) section.

## Why is planned maintenance important?

* **Improves performance** - Regular updates and optimizations help keep the platform running smoothly and efficiently.
* **Enhances security** - Applying security patches helps protect against vulnerabilities and keeps your data safe.
* **Ensures reliability** - Routine checks and fixes prevent issues that could lead to downtime or data loss.
* **Compliance** - Regular maintenance helps in adhering to industry standards and regulatory requirements.

## How does planned maintenance affect users?

### For vendors and partners

* **Temporary inaccessibility** - During maintenance windows, some parts of the platform might be unavailable.
* **Notification in advance** - Vendors will be notified in advance about the scheduled maintenance, including expected downtime and which areas will be affected.
* **Minimal disruption** - We aim to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours to limit disruptions to your business operations.

### For clients

* **Service interruptions** - Certain functionalities might be temporarily unavailable.
* **Advance notice** - Clients receive prior information about when the maintenance will occur and the potential impact.
* **Improved services** - After maintenance, clients can expect improved platform performance and new features or enhancements.

## How do we communicate planned maintenance?

* **Advance notifications** - Notifications are sent out well before the scheduled maintenance, through emails and alerts.
* **Detailed information** - Notifications include the date, time, expected duration, and a list of affected services or functionalities.
* **Status updates** - Real-time updates are provided during the maintenance to keep all users informed about the progress. See [Status Page](https://status.platform.softwareone.com).
* **Completion notice** - Once maintenance is completed, a follow-up communication confirms the return to normal operations.

## Best practices for handling planned maintenance

* **Read notifications** - Always read maintenance notifications to know when and how you might be affected.
* **Plan ahead** - Adjust your schedule if needed to minimize the impact on your workflows.
* **Contact support** - If you have any questions or face issues during maintenance, our support team is available to assist you.
