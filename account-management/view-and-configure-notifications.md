The Notification Hub is a centralized place where you to view and manage notifications. There are two types of notifications in the Client Portal:

| Notification type | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| System            | The system notifications are associated with your profile. You cannot subscribe or unsubscribe from these notifications.                  |
|                   | The user notifications are also called as feature notifications. These notifications are sent only if you are subscribed to receive them. |
| User              |                                                                                                                                           |
