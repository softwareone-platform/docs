Choose whether the user will be able to access the following data:

* Any account out of existing the providers.
* Selected cloud accounts (Tenants).
* Selected subscriptions.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**: Defining access at the Provider level gives access to all Accounts and Subscriptions including those added in the future. Users will get access to new entities automatically. The same rule applies for defining access on the Account (Tenant) level.

### Requesting procurement settings

Newly created users will not have Procurement Settings provided. Users need to be defined to transact through PyraCloud, therefore it may not be possible to enable some of the features for such users.

You can request for these users to be configured. First, choose the **Procurement** tab and click on the **Request Procurement** option.

The Procurement Request form will be displayed. Fill in the information and confirm by clicking the "Request Procurement" option. The request will be processed by a SoftwareOne sales representative.
