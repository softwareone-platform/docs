# Collaboration Site

***

The Collaboration Site allows you to share files that are too large to be shared via email, for example, your project files and deliverables for a managed service engagement.

### Accessing Collaboration Site  <a href="#navigating-to-the-collaboration-site" id="navigating-to-the-collaboration-site"></a>

**To access the Collaboration Site**

1. Select your account menu in the upper-right corner of the top navigation bar.
2. Choose **Collaboration Site.**

The Collaboration Site page will display the workspaces that you have access to. If you have access to only one workspace, you are automatically redirected to the content.
