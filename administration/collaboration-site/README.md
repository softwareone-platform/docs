# Collaboration Site

***

The Collaboration Site allows you to share files that are too large to be shared via email, for example, your project files and deliverables for a managed service engagement.&#x20;

Access to the Collaboration Site is based on permissions and only authorized users can access the site.

### Security and Permissions

Initially, only top-level administrators are granted access to the Collaboration Site. If you cannot view this module, contact your administrator or your SoftwareOne Account Manager.

Administrators can assign user permissions in two different ways - through the User Management module or directly from the Collaboration Site. For information assigning permissions, see [Working with Collaboration Site](working-with-collaboration-site.md).

When assigning access permissions to the other users, administrators can also manage access to each workspace. A workspace is an area where you can share files and links with other users. The following are the different levels of access to a workspace:

* **None**: Access is not permitted. Users cannot view the workspace and it's not displayed in the list of available workspaces.
* **Read**: Users can access all elements of the workspace in read-only mode. Users can browse through a directory structure, list files, and download them. Modification of resources is not allowed.
* **Read, Write**: Users have all permissions included in the Read mode. Additionally, users can upload files, create directories and links, delete files, directories, and links.

After the access is granted, authorized users can perform the following actions:

* [Download files and folders](working-with-collaboration-site.md#downloading-files-and-folders)
* [Create new folders](working-with-collaboration-site.md#creating-a-new-folder)
* [Add files to a folder](working-with-collaboration-site.md#uploading-files)
* [Rename files and folders](working-with-collaboration-site.md#renaming-files-and-folders)
* [Delete files and folders](working-with-collaboration-site.md#deleting-files-and-folders)
* [Move files and folders to a different location](working-with-collaboration-site.md#moving-files-and-folders)
