# Purchase Approval Groups

***

Workflows and approval groups allow you to simplify the configuration and maintenance of approval limits. Approval groups represent a set of individuals who can approve the orders. Approval groups are assigned to users.

The purpose of approval groups is to create a collection of users who are responsible for approvals. To reduce the effort of maintaining a group, you can link approval groups together through parent-child relationships.

Each approval group can only have one parent but can be used as the child in many approval groups.

**NOTE**: Only administrators can Purchase Approval Workflows. If any other user requires access, either the administrator can set it up or the user can contact their SoftwareOne representative.
