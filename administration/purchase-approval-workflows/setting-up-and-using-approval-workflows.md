### Creating an approval group

You can create up to 3 levels of purchase approval groups.

**To create an approval group**

1. From the main navigation menu, navigate to **Setup** and select **Purchase Approval Setup**.
2. Select **New Group**. The Create Approval Group window opens.
3. Provide a name for your approval group, select the approval level, and log in from the list.
