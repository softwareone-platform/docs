When the software assets integration is enabled, you can control transaction filtering or turn off the integration by selecting **Manage**.&#x20;

By default, the filtering is turned on. It means that transactions relating to Azure or O365 will not be visible in the Spend Management modules.

Any changes to filtering settings take effect after 24 hours.

**IMPORTANT**: Take caution when disabling software asset integration. You can always enable it again, however, all transaction allocation and/or tag assignments will need to be redone.
