* The steps in the purchase wizard are defined by the vendor and might vary for each product. This topic only describes the steps at a high level.
* If you're buying a product under an existing agreement, the agreement must be in the **Active** state. Agreements in any other state cannot be used for making new purchases.&#x20;

## Buy products and services

Follow these steps to create a new purchase order under a new agreement:&#x20;

1. From the main menu, navigate to **Marketplace** > **Products**. The main page of the catalog containing product cards opens.&#x20;
2. Choose the product you want to buy and click **Buy now**. The purchase wizard for your selected product opens.&#x20;
3. In the **Select agreement** section, choose whether you want to use an existing agreement or create a new agreement.&#x20;
   * To create a new agreement, click **Create new agreement**.

5. Continue through the purchase wizard and complete all sections, including the items section where you can add items to your order and review prices for each item.
6. In the **Order details** section, update the agreement name. Optionally, add your reference number and order notes. Click **Next**.
7. In the **Review order** section, read the terms and select the checkbox to accept. Click **Next**.&#x20;
8. Review the details of your order and click **Place order**.

After placing the order, you'll see the order status as **Processing** and your agreement status as **Provisioning** on the **Summary** page.&#x20;

You can either close the purchase wizard or click **View order** to see your order details.
