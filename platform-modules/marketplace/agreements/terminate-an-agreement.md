# Terminate an agreement

If you want to cancel all subscriptions under an agreement and terminate your agreement completely, you can do so by creating a termination order.&#x20;

## Before you begin <a href="#before-you-begin" id="before-you-begin"></a>

Before terminating an agreement, note the following points:

* You can only terminate agreements that are in the **Active** state. Agreements in any other state (such as **Processing** or **Updating**) cannot be terminated. For a description of these states, see [Agreements interface](agreements-interface.md).
* Creating a termination order doesn't immediately cancel your agreement. An agreement is terminated only after the vendor has approved it for termination.

## Terminate an agreement

Follow these steps to terminate your agreement:

1. Navigate to the **Agreements** page (**Marketplace** > **Agreements**). A list of your agreements is displayed.
