# Add Items to an Agreement

You can add more items to an agreement as long as your agreement is **Active**. Additional items can be added by selecting the agreement and using the **Buy more** option on the agreement's details page.&#x20;

When adding items, you can view the estimated cost impact of your changes, including the unit price and the revised monthly and yearly price for each item. After adding items, a change order is automatically created in the system and sent to the vendor for fulfillment.

## Add more items to an agreement

Follow these steps to add more items to your agreement:

1. Navigate to the **Agreements** page (**Marketplace** > **Agreements**). A list of your agreements is displayed.

   2. Click **Add items** again.
   3. Review the details including prices and then click **Next** to continue.&#x20;
5. Complete the **Details** section of the wizard as required and click **Next**.
6. Review your order and click **Place order**.&#x20;

A change order is created in the system and sent to the vendor for fulfillment.&#x20;

While the change order is in progress, the agreement shows as **Updating**. The agreement is temporarily locked, and no further orders can be placed under this agreement until the current change order is completed.
