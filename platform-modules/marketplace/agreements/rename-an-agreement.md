# Rename an agreement

You can make certain changes to your agreement after it's created. This might include renaming the agreement and [editing the agreement ID](edit-agreement-id.md).

Before renaming an agreement, note the following points:

* You can only rename an agreement if it's in the **Active** state.
* An agreement name cannot be blank. If the name is empty or invalid, the platform displays a message.
