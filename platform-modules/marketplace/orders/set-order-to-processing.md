# Set the order to Processing

You might be asked to provide more information if there are errors in the information you provided during the purchase process, or if we require additional details to accept or process your order.&#x20;

When an order needs your attention, its status is marked as **Querying**. You can check the **General** tab within the order's details page for a message indicating what needs to be corrected.&#x20;

After you've taken the required action and fixed the parameters, you must click **Process** to change the order status from **Querying** to **Processing**. Changing the status informs the vendor that the order is now ready for their review.&#x20;

## Set the order to Processing

Follow these steps to set your order to **Processing**:

1. Navigate to the **Orders** page (**Marketplace** > **Orders**). A list of your orders is displayed.
2. Click the relevant order. If you have a long list of orders, use filters to find orders with the **Querying** status**.**&#x20;
3. Review the message in the header and fix the parameters as necessary. The following image shows an example message:

4. Click **Process**. The order status changes to **Processing**. If the **Process** button is unavailable, make sure you've fixed all errors in the **Ordering** parameters.&#x20;

There might be situations where certain issues need to be fixed outside the Marketplace Platform. For example, when you need to accept a GDAP invite. In such scenarios, you must complete the necessary tasks and then return to the Marketplace Platform to move the order to the **Processing** state.&#x20;
