## About Requests

In the context of the Marketplace Platform, a request is a pre-sale inquiry created through the Request module. An inquiry represents questions about products, such as pricing, billing, product availability, and licensing.

## How to access the Requests page <a href="#how-to-access-the-requests-page" id="how-to-access-the-requests-page"></a>

You can access the **Requests** page by navigating to the main menu and selecting **Marketplace** > **Requests**.

From the **Requests** page, you can:

* View all requests that you've created along with their status.
* Change the status of your request to notify the vendor that your request is ready for their action.
* Close your request after your query has been answered.
* Add comments to the request and upload supporting documents for vendors and other members of your account.
