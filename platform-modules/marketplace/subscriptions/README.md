## About Subscriptions

The Subscriptions module in the Marketplace Platform is a single reference point for your subscriptions, allowing you to view and manage all of your purchased subscriptions.&#x20;

A subscription refers to the ongoing provision of service under the terms and conditions detailed in your agreement. Subscriptions allow you to use a resource based on the number of licenses you order. In the Marketplace Platform, subscriptions are renewed automatically by default, unless you [cancel them](terminate-a-subscription.md).&#x20;

## How to access the Subscriptions page

You can access the **Subscriptions** page by navigating to the main menu and selecting **Marketplace** > **Subscriptions**.&#x20;

From the **Subscriptions** page, you can:&#x20;

* View all of your subscriptions in one place, along with the estimated cost for each subscription. You can also use filters to find specific subscriptions that meet certain criteria.&#x20;
* Change the name of your subscription as needed to reflect the service.&#x20;
* Adjust the license quantity or the number of purchased items, while your subscription is in **Active** status.
* Remove the default Marketplace ID assigned to your subscription and assign a unique identifier of your choice.&#x20;
* Submit a request to terminate a single or multiple subscriptions in your agreement.&#x20;
