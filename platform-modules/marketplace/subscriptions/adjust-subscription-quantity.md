# Adjust subscription quantity

You can add or remove items from your subscription as long as your subscription and its associated agreement are **Active**.&#x20;

Quantity can be adjusted as needed using the **Edit** option on the subscription's details page. While adjusting the quantity, you can view the estimated cost impact of your changes, including the unit price and the revised monthly and yearly price for each item. After you change quantities, a change order is automatically created in the system and sent to the vendor for fulfillment. &#x20;

## Before you begin

Before adjusting the quantity, note the following points:

* You cannot change the quantity to zero for subscriptions with only one item. In such cases, you must terminate the subscription entirely. For more information, see [Terminate subscriptions](terminate-a-subscription.md).
* If your subscription includes several items, there must be at least one item where the quantity is greater than zero. You cannot change the quantity of all items to zero.&#x20;

## Change the quantity of subscription items

Follow these steps to change the quantity of a subscription item:

1. Navigate to the **Subscriptions** page (**Marketplace** > **Subscriptions**). A list of your subscriptions is displayed.

A change order is created in the system and sent to the vendor for processing.&#x20;

During the change order, both the subscription and the agreement show as **Updating** on the **Subscriptions** page. The agreement is temporarily locked, and no further orders can be placed under this agreement until the current change order is completed.
