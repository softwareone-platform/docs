# Subscription States

Subscriptions in the Marketplace Platform can be in different states (also known as status). The following diagram shows the possible states and the transition between these states:

The subscription states are visible in the platform as **Status**. These states are also displayed as an icon beside the name of the subscription and its ID on the details page.&#x20;
