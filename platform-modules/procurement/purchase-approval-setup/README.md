# Purchase approval setup

The Marketplace Platform allows you to set up approval workflows and approval groups depending on the price or publisher. An approval group represents a set of individuals who can approve orders.&#x20;

By creating workflows and approval groups, you can simplify the configuration and maintenance of the approval limits assigned to individual users.&#x20;

After creating groups, you can maintain them easily by linking approval groups together through parent-child relationships. Each approval group can only have one parent but it can be used as a child in several approval groups.
