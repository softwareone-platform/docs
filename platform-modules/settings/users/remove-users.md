# Remove users

In certain situations, you might need to remove a person from your account. Only account administrators can remove users.

Before removing a user, note the following points:

* Ensure that you've reviewed the user's permissions and assigned groups. This is necessary to prevent accidental removal.
* Removing a user doesn't delete them from the system. This allows you to reinvite them to your account. For more information, see [Invite new users](add-new-users.md).
* Removing a user only removes them from the respective account. If the user is associated with several accounts on the platform, they'll still be able to access those accounts.&#x20;

Follow these steps to remove an individual from your account:

1. Navigate to the **Users** page (**Settings** > **Users**) and find the user to remove.

A message is displayed stating that the user is removed.&#x20;

After you've removed the user, they'll receive an email stating that they've been removed from the account and the associated user groups.&#x20;

Remember that if the user belongs to multiple accounts on the Marketplace Platform, they'll still be able to access those accounts.
