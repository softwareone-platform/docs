2. Navigate to the **Licensees** page (**Settings** > **Licensee**) and click **Add Licensee**. The **Add Licensee** page opens.&#x20;
3. In the **General** section, do the following:

   * **External reference** - (Optional) Provide a reference or identifier for the licensee.
   * **Description** - (Optional) Add a description for the licensee.
4. In the **Buyer** section, choose the legal entity to be used during transactions. Note that you can link a licensee to one buyer only.&#x20;
5. In the **Seller** section, select the SoftwareOne entity that will facilitate transactions.&#x20;
6. In the **Contact person** section, choose if you want to assign a contact to the licensee. You can also select an existing user or create a new contact.
