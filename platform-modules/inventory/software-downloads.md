# Software downloads

The **Software Downloads** module lets you download software packages that SoftwareOne provides, and upload your files and packages to the cloud storage.  To access software downloads, navigate to the [main menu](../../getting-started/platform-overview/interface.md#main-menu) of the Client Portal and select **Inventory** > **Software Downloads**.&#x20;

## Uploading software packages or files

{% hint style="info" %}
Uploading software packages is a paid feature. If you don't see the **Upload** tab in the Software Download module, contact your SoftwareOne representative.
{% endhint %}

A package is a bundle of one or more files containing descriptive metadata. Packages are uploaded to collections. A collection is an isolated storage space. If a collection doesn't exist for your company, you'll see an option to create a new collection. The option will be unavailable if a collection already exists. After creating a collection, you can upload your packages/files and distribute them to the other users via email or through the Client Portal.

Follow these steps to create a new collection:

1. Open the **Software Downloads** module and navigate to the **Upload** tab.
2. Provide a name for your collection.
3. Select **Save**.

Follow these steps to start the upload process:

1. On the **Upload** tab, select **Start your Upload Process**.
2. On the **Create Package** page, choose a collection from the list and select **Next**.
3. Provide a name and description of your package. Note that you can create and upload more than one package to a collection. Select **Next**.
4. Add the metadata for the package/file and select **Next**. The following fields are mandatory:
   * Description
   * Publisher
   * Product Family
   * Operating System
   * Language
5. Choose the file you want to add and select **Next**.
6. Review the details and select **Next** to create and upload the package. A confirmation message is displayed when the file is added.

## Generating an email link

You can generate an email link to share with anyone in your organization. Note that the person accessing the link doesn't need to have a Client Portal account because the link uses a unique access key.

Follow these steps to generate a link:

1\. From the **Actions** column, select **Email**.

2\. Select the duration that the link will be valid for and the total number of available downloads.

3\. Select **OK**. An email with a link to the package will open.

{% hint style="info" %}
The email link will only be valid for the duration that you choose. The link expires when the duration ends, regardless of the number of downloads.
{% endhint %}

The **History** tab displays all of your file uploads and downloads.  You can view the data or export it to a CSV and Excel file.

Follow these steps to export the report:

1. Select the **Export** option**.**
