1. From the main menu, navigate to **Inventory** and select **Invoices**. The Invoices page opens where you can view a list of invoices.
   * If you have a long list of invoices, you can refine the list based on the filters and search options.
   * Select the appropriate search options, and select **Search**. If you want to reset the filter options, select **Reset**.

When you select an invoice on the Invoices page, the details page opens.
