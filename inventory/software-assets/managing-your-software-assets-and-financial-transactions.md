# Managing your software assets and financial transactions

### Viewing software assets and financial transactions

**To view your software assets and financial transactions**

1\. From the main navigation menu, navigate to **Inventory** and select **Software Assets**.

2\. Use the search options to view your software asset inventory list. You can either enter your PO number or reference number in the **Reference** field or use the filters to narrow down the search results.

3\. Review the details on the **Software Assets** and **Financial Transactions** tabs.

The **Software Assets** tab displays your active software subscriptions and current spend only. It does not display your past payments. The Financial Transactions tab displays your entire spending across all software, including subscriptions and your past transactions.

### Exporting your software asset inventory list

You can use the **Export** option to export your software asset inventory list to a number of formats. The export templates allow you to export the software asset data in the most commonly configured format (column namings/order) for a number of Software Asset Management (SAM) tools, such as:

* Aspera
* Miss Marple
* Snow
* Flexera
* Service Now

Depending on your SAM Tool setup, you may need to amend the standard reporting templates. To learn more about the reporting templates, see Software Transaction Reports.

From the **Exports** menu, you can also export your Assets Default, Financial Statement, and Customer License Statement to various formats.
