# Working with software downloads

The Software Downloads module allows you to download software packages that SoftwareOne provides. You can also use this module to upload your files and packages to the cloud storage, add metadata for the files (for example, bundle several files into a package, provide a file name, define the publisher/version, and so on), and distribute those packages.

**NOTE**: Uploading software packages or files is a paid feature. If you don't see the **Upload** tab in the Software Download module, contact your SoftwareOne Sales team.

After creating a collection, you can upload your packages/files and distribute them to the other users via email or through the Client Portal.

### Uploading packages

A package is a bundle of one or more files with additional descriptive metadata attached. After you create a collection, the **Start your Upload Process** option is displayed.
