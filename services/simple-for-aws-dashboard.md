# Simple for AWS dashboard

The Simple for AWS dashboard in PyraCloud provides an overview for customers taking advantage of SoftwareONE’s Simple for AWS service.

The dashboard provides:

* A single point of access to relevant parts of the PyraCloud platform (ie. invoices, user administration, collaboration site etc.)
* Quarterly spend information
* Help & support tickets
* Service recommendations and articles

If you have multiple Microsoft tenants, you will see a dropdown next to your tenant name on the Simple for AWS dashboard, allowing you to switch between tenants.

When you switch tenant, the widget values in the dashboard will change accordingly.

As tenants are permission based, some users may not see all available customer tenants.

Widgets like “Invoices”, “Add user” and “Service Review” are based on user or content permissions.

Users will see widgets based on their user or content permissions.

This widget provides a quick overview of all requests and incidents reported in the past 90 days, including their respective status.

If no tickets have been logged, users will have the option to create a new request/incident.

Clicking on the widget takes you to the “Help and Support” page where all ticket details can be found.

### Data Refresh Rate <a href="#data-refresh-rate" id="data-refresh-rate"></a>

As Simple for AWS surfaces data from multiple platform systems, there may be a difference in data refresh rate across the widgets. The below table describes each widget and its data refresh rate.

| **Widget**       | **Refresh rate**                |
