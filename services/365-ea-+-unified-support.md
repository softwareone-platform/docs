# 365 EA + Unified support

***

The Microsoft 365 EA with Unified Support Dashboard provides an overview for Microsoft 365 EA customers who purchased our unified support service.&#x20;

The dashboard contains quick links and provides a single point of access to relevant parts of the platform, for example, invoices and user administration.

You can also use the dashboard to view:

* Product usage
* Subscription assignment details
* Help and support tickets
* Recent news from Microsoft
* Collaboration site

As 365Simple surfaces data from multiple platform systems, there might be a difference in data refresh rate across the widgets. The following table describes each widget and its data refresh rate.

| Widget                          |                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Product Usage                   | Once a day                      |
| Top 5 Subscriptions by Assigned | Once a day                      |
| Support tickets                 | Every hour (after page refresh) |
| Service Review                  | Latest with every page refresh  |

### Selecting your tenant <a href="#block-447a38eb-23c7-4b77-987f-9fc26ac2dee0" id="block-447a38eb-23c7-4b77-987f-9fc26ac2dee0"></a>

If you have multiple Microsoft tenants, you can switch between tenants. When you switch tenants, the values in the dashboard change accordingly.

**NOTE**: As tenants are permission-based, not all users will see all available customer tenants.

The **Invoices**, **Add user**, and **Service Review** widgets on the page are based on user or content permissions. If you are unable to see these widgets, contact your administrator to check your permissions

### Understanding product usage and subscription assignment <a href="#block-ea488296-a0d5-4f23-b3c0-87a329f8d1bd" id="block-ea488296-a0d5-4f23-b3c0-87a329f8d1bd"></a>

In contrast to billing information, it's not possible to view usage and subscription assignments per agreement (this is not supported by vendors). Therefore **Product Usage** and **Top 5 Assigned Subscriptions** show information per Microsoft tenant (as noted on the yellow label within

The **Product Usage** widget provides you with an overview of active and inactive licenses and highlights opportunities to adjust the use vs. cost ratio. Selecting the widget redirects you to 365Analytics where you can perform in-depth analysis.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE:** Users without permission cannot access 365Analytics.

**Top 5 Subscriptions By Assigned can also be used to evaluate subscription utilization** and accompanying costs. Selecting the widget redirects you to a full consumption report where you can see a detailed analysis.
