# Open Source

SoftwareOne firmly believes in the power of open source as a solution to real-life issues that the community faces. We are passionate about collaborative efforts and always appreciate active participation. This is an exciting era of utilizing technology to create diverse tools, applications, and services.

We're in the process of designing an open-source program. Our goal is to simplify the process so everyone can comfortably use, contribute to, and release open-source solutions. We've made a selection of our tools and methodologies accessible for your learning benefit.

We use GitHub to host all our projects - learn more at our [GitHub Projects](github-projects.md) page.

We're thrilled to have you join our open community. Please familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) and [Contributor License Agreement](contributor-license-agreement.md) (CLA) to ensure respectful and constructive participation.
