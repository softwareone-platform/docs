# Notifications API

The Notifications API allows you to manage and deliver notifications within the SoftwareOne Marketplace Platform.&#x20;

With this API, you can:

* Create and retrieve notification batches (emails) sent to specific categories and contacts. You can also retrieve attachments associated with those messages.
* Create and manage notification categories (like Orders, Subscriptions, and more).
* Create and manage contacts. Contacts are the recipients who receive notifications.
* Retrieve sent messages and delivery information.
