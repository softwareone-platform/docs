# Resource Query Language

Resource Query Language (RQL) is a query language used by the Marketplace Platform in its REST API. It is used for querying and manipulating resources in the Marketplace Platform's [REST API](./).&#x20;

With RQL, you can filter, sort, paginate, and project data. It is simple to use but flexible enough to handle complex scenarios.

## Using RQL&#x20;

RQL consists of a set of operators that can be classified into three main categories:

1. **Comparison Operators** - These perform comparisons like equals, greater than, etc.
2. **Logical Operators** - These combine multiple conditions.
3. **Algorithmic Operators** - These handle functionalities like sorting and pagination.

Operators are formatted as `operator(arg1,arg2,...)`. Complex expressions can be created by nesting these operators.

## Practical examples

Suppose you want to list all users with a specific domain. Implementing filtering is essential, and this is where RQL comes in.

### **Basic filtering**

To display all users with the first name 'Buzz, your `GET` request will look like this:

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?firstName=Buzz
```

The same expression can be written as:&#x20;

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?eq(firstName,Buzz)
```

### Sorting

To sort users based on their first name, your `GET` request will look like this:

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?order=firstName
```

To sort in the opposite direction, the '-' operator can be used:

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?order=-firstName
```

### Pagination

To paginate your results with a limit of 10 users and to retrieve the third page (offset 20):

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?limit=10&offset=20
```

* The first parameter `limit=10` expresses the number of users to return
* The second parameter offset=`20` offsets the starting position in the result set. The first 20 users will be skipped.

### Projection

To request specific fields, such as `forstName`, `lastName`, and `email` to be included, the `select=+` operator can be used:

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?select=+firstName,+lastName,+email
```

To request certain fields to be excluded, the `select=-` operator can be used:

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?select=-firstName,-lastName,-email
```

### Search

To search for all users with the first name starting from 'Bu', the following query can be used:

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?ilike(firstName,Bu*)
```

the operator `ilike` performs a case-insensitive search.

### Combining operators

Logical operators can be used to combine multiple operators. For example, to filter users with first name 'Buzz' and last name 'Astral:

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?and(eq(firstName,Buzz),eq(lastName,Astral))
```

In simple cases, a combined expression can also be written in the following form:

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?firstName=Buzz&lastName=Astral
```

### Special characters in values

To pass special characters (like, &^$?) or whitespaces as values to RQL operators, enclose them in either double quotes (") or single quotes (') as shown in the following example:

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?firstName="Buzz !!!"
```

If you need to include a quotation mark within the value, you can do so by enclosing it with a different type of quotation mark, as shown in the following example:

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?firstName="Buzz with the ' Quote"
```

Allowing you to pass these special symbols as values.

### The asterisk Character and the ilike operator

The asterisk (\*) character has a special meaning in the `ilike` operator, matching zero or more characters in its place from the parameter value. For example, the "\*dog" pattern will match strings like "big dog" and "dog," but it will not match "big dog!" because of the exclamation mark.

If you need to use the asterisk (\*) character itself in the pattern, you can escape it as '\*', as shown in the following example:

```http
GET /v1/accounts/users?ilike(firstName,"The\**")
```

The ilike operator in this case will be searching for the literal value “The\*” at the beginning of the firstName property.
