# Audit API

The Audit API enables you to track and retrieve activity logs across the Marketplace Platform so you have full visibility into key actions taken by users or systems.

With this API, you can create new audit records programmatically, retrieve a list of logged events for monitoring or compliance purposes, and get detailed information about specific events. The API consists of two core objects: Audit Record and Audit Event Type.&#x20;

Use the following buttons to open the specification in Swagger Editor or download the full API spec:
