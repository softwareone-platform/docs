# Catalog API

The Catalog API enables you to create, retrieve, and manage products. You can also configure individual items as well as item groups through the API.&#x20;

Additionally, you can define parameters and parameter groups, and manage pricing with price lists. You can also create custom templates and product variants. The API also includes endpoints for managing product media, documents, listings, and terms and conditions.

Use the following buttons to open the API in Swagger Editor or download the full specification:
