# Spotlight API

Marketplace Platform's Spotlight API provides endpoints designed to highlight key platform objects that may need attention. These objects can include agreements, orders, subscriptions, invoices, and more.

The API consists of two primary endpoints: Spotlight Object and Spotlight Query. With this API, you can:

* List all spotlighted objects.
* Invalidate or clear the cache for Spotlight objects.
* List the defined spotlight queries.
* Get details for a specific spotlight query.
* Update an existing spotlight query.
