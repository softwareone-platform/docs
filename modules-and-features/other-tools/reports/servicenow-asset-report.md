# ServiceNow Asset Report

We have created an asset report template specifically for ServiceNow.&#x20;

You can download the report and upload it directly to your ServiceNow to populate your software assets.

To access the report, navigate to **Inventory** > **Software Assets**. When the Software Assets page displays, hover over **Exports** and choose **Service Now**.

For information on how to create a report, see [Creating reports](./#post-4285-_ref38442975).
