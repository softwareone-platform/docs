# Account

An account enables a company or organization to sign in to the Marketplace platform and access the modules and features enabled for your account by SoftwareOne.

The platform supports various account types, including client and vendor accounts, each offering different functionalities based on the account type.&#x20;

Account administrators can view account information on the **Account** page.
