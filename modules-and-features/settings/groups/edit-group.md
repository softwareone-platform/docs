# Edit Group

Account administrators can edit a group to update the group's general information and manage its members. When editing a group, administrators also adjust the buyer settings to provide either full or restricted access to buyers.

Before editing a group, note the following points:

* For default groups, you can add new members and remove existing ones, as well as update the group's general information.
* The modules currently enabled for the group cannot be changed.&#x20;
* You can update the buyer visibility only if the **Marketplace** module is enabled for the group. If the module wasn't enabled during the group's creation, you can enable it while editing the group, if the group is not a default one.
* &#x20;Buyer access restrictions only apply to the **Marketplace** module.

### Editing a group

To edit a group:

1. Navigate to the **Groups** page.
2. Select the actions icon (**•••**) for the group to edit. Then, select **Edit**.
3. In the **Edit group** wizard, modify the following information as needed:
   1. **General** - Update the group's name and description.
   2. **Modules** - Update the modules to which the group members should have access. Note that access cannot be updated for a default group.
