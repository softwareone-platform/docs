# Edit Group

You can edit a group to update the group's general information and manage group members. When editing a group, you can also update the group's buyer setting to allow full or restricted access to the buyers.

Before editing a group, note the following points:

* For default groups, you can only update the group's general information and add or remove members from the group. You can't change the modules enabled for the default group.
* You can update the buyer visibility only if the Marketplace module has been enabled for the group. If the module was not enabled during group creation, you can enable it by editing the group, as long as the group is not a default one.
* &#x20;Buyer access restrictions apply to the Marketplace module only.
