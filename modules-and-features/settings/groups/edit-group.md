# Edit Group

You can edit a group to update the group's general information and manage group members. When editing a group, you can also update the group's buyer setting to allow full or restricted access to the buyers.

Before editing a group, note the following points:

* For default groups, you can only update the group's general information and add or remove members from the group. You can't change the modules enabled for such groups.
* You can update the buyer visibility only if the **Marketplace** module is enabled for the group. If the module was not enabled during group creation, you can enable it by editing the group, as long as the group is not a default one.
* &#x20;Buyer access restrictions apply to the **Marketplace** module only.
