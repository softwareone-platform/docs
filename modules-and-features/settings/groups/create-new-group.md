# Create New Group

In the SoftwareOne Marketplace, account administrators can create new groups and add members to those groups.

When creating groups, administrators choose the modules to enable for group members. Additionally, administrators can also restrict group members to certain buyers. It means you can define whether your group members should see all buyers in your account or specific buyers only.&#x20;

### Creating a new group

To create a new group:

1. Navigate to the **Groups** page. Then, select **Add**.
2. In the **Add group** wizard, do the following:
   1. **General** - Enter the following details, then select **Next:**
      * **Name** - (Required) Provide a name for your group. We recommend that you enter a unique name so you can identify the group easily in your list of groups.
      * **Description** - (Optional) Add a description for the group. You could enter information about the group members, their roles, and so on. &#x20;
   2. **Modules** - Choose the modules you want to enable for the group. You must select at least one module. When done, select **Next**.&#x20;
   3.  **Buyers** - Choose if you want to allow your group members to view all buyers in your account or only certain buyers.&#x20;
