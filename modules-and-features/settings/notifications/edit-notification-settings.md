# Edit Notification Settings

The **Settings** tab within the Notifications module lets you view and manage the account-level settings for your notifications. Only account administrators can access and update these settings.&#x20;

The settings you define on this page are global, meaning they apply to all email notifications, regardless of the category. You can update details, such as the sender's name, the language of emails, and the email footer.
