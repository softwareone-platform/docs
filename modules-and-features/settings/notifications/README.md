# Notifications

Notifications Management allows account administrators to configure recipients and manage the notification categories for their account. These notifications are sent via email to alert recipients about the events in their account so they can keep up-to-date and take proactive actions as necessary.

The Marketplace Platform supports various categories that can be easily enabled or disabled from the interface. Administrators also have the flexibility to define recipients at the account level. They can specify individual users or a group of users as recipients of these emails. Individual users can manage notifications for their profiles through the **My profile** option in the account menu.&#x20;

## Notification categories <a href="#notification_types" id="notification_types"></a>

In the Marketplace Platform, all related notification emails are grouped together as categories.

Each category consolidates emails of a similar type, allowing you to manage preferences at the category level instead of handling each email individually. For example, when you disable the Orders category, you'll stop receiving all order-related emails.&#x20;

The following table lists the categories supported by email notifications:

<table><thead><tr><th width="227">Category name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Account</td><td>These notifications alert recipients to the changes in the account. For instance, when a new user is added or an existing one is removed.</td></tr><tr><td>Billing and Invoice</td><td>These notifications relate to billing updates and invoices in your account. For instance, when a new statement is generated.</td></tr><tr><td>Catalog</td><td>These notifications are sent when the catalog has been updated to change the product's status and pricing.</td></tr><tr><td>News and updates</td><td>These notifications alert recipients to the platform news and latest announcements, such as feature releases, upcoming maintenance, and more. </td></tr><tr><td>Orders</td><td>These notifications are sent when there's an order-related activity in your account. For instance, when you place a new order or the status of your existing order changes. </td></tr><tr><td>Programs</td><td>These notifications relate to enrollments and certificates. For instance, when your enrollment request has been approved by the vendor.</td></tr><tr><td>Quotes</td><td>These notifications relate to your requests for a quotation. </td></tr><tr><td>Requests</td><td>These notifications alert you to the submitted requests in your account. For instance, when the status of your request changes, when you need to action a request, and so on.</td></tr><tr><td>Subscriptions</td><td>The platform sends these notifications for subscription-related updates to your account. For instance, renewal updates or when a new subscription is created.</td></tr><tr><td>User updates</td><td>These email notifications are sent when you update your profile. For instance, when you update your password. You cannot opt out of these notifications. </td></tr></tbody></table>

You can manage these categories from the **Notifications** > **Subscribers** page. See [Enable or Disable Categories](enable-or-disable-categories.md) to learn more.

## Accessing notifications

Account administrators can view notification categories and all messages that have been triggered for their account on the **Notifications** page. This page is available under **Settings** in the main menu.

The **Notifications** page contains tabs that provide information about account-level notifications. The following table describes these tabs:

<table><thead><tr><th width="186">Tab</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Subscribers</strong></td><td>Displays all <a href="./#notification_types">notification categories</a> that have been configured for your account. You can also view the description of each category, its recipients (including users and groups), and the category's status.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Messages</strong></td><td><p>Contains all messages that have been triggered within your account. You can view details for each message, including the ID, subject line, recipient's email address, message status, and more. </p><p></p><p>In <strong>Users</strong> column, you can view the name and ID of the individual associated with the contact. If the field is empty, it means the recipient doesn't have an account on the platform. </p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Settings</strong></td><td>The <strong>Settings</strong> tab allows you to view and edit your account-level notification settings, such as the sender name, the default language you wish to use for all emails, and the email's footer.
