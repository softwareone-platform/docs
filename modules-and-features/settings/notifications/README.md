# Notifications

Notifications Management allows account administrators to configure recipients and manage the notification categories for their account. Notifications are sent as email messages to alert recipients about the events in the account so they can keep up-to-date and take proactive actions as necessary. All notification emails are sent from SoftwareOne's email address.&#x20;

The Marketplace Platform supports various categories that admins can enable or disable from the interface. Admins also have the flexibility to define recipients at the account level. They can specify specific users or a group of users as recipients of these notification emails.&#x20;

Individual users can manage notifications for their profiles through the **My profile** option in the account menu.

## Notification categories <a href="#notification_types" id="notification_types"></a>

In the Marketplace Platform, notifications are alerts that are generated by the platform. For&#x20;example, alerts related to order status changes, subscription upsizes or downsizes, invoice generation, and so on.

All related email messages are grouped together as categories, allowing you to manage preferences at the category level instead of handling each email individually. For example, if you disable the **Orders** category, you'll stop receiving all order-related emails.&#x20;

The following table lists the supported categories:

<table><thead><tr><th width="227">Category name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Account</td><td>These notifications alert recipients to the changes in the account. For instance, when a new user is added to the account or an existing one is removed.</td></tr><tr><td>Billing and invoice</td><td>These notifications relate to billing updates and invoices in your account. For instance, when a new statement is generated.</td></tr><tr><td>Catalog</td><td>These notifications are sent when the catalog has been updated to change the product's status and pricing.</td></tr><tr><td>News and updates</td><td>These notifications alert recipients to the platform news and latest announcements, such as feature releases, upcoming maintenance, and more. </td></tr><tr><td>Orders</td><td>These notifications are sent when there's an order-related activity in your account. For instance, when you place a new order or the status of your existing order changes. </td></tr><tr><td>Programs</td><td>These notifications relate to your enrollments and certificates. For instance, when your enrollment request is approved by the vendor or your certificate is querying for additional information.</td></tr><tr><td>Quotes</td><td>These notifications relate to your requests for a quotation. </td></tr><tr><td>Requests</td><td>These notifications alert you to the submitted requests in your account. For instance, when the status of your request changes, when you need to action a request, and so on.</td></tr><tr><td>Subscriptions</td><td>The platform sends these notifications for subscription-related updates to your account. For instance, when a new subscription is created or when its due renewal.</td></tr><tr><td>User updates</td><td>These email notifications are sent when you update your profile. For instance, your password. You can't opt out of these notifications. </td></tr></tbody></table>

Admins can manage these categories from the **Notifications** > **Subscribers** page. See [Enable or Disable Categories](enable-or-disable-categories.md) to learn more.

## Accessing notifications

Admins can view the notification categories and the messages triggered for the users within their account on the **Notifications** page. The page is available under **Settings** in the main menu.
