# Viewing Message Details

Account administrators can use the **Messages** tab to view all notification emails triggered for the users in their account.&#x20;

The list includes messages that were sent successfully, as well as those that couldn't be delivered. There are several ways to filter messages to view only those you are interested in. See [Customize the Data Grid](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md) to learn more.

For each message, you can view various details, including the message ID, the email address of the recipient, their user ID on the platform, the timestamp of when the message was created, the status of the message, and more.

To view the full details of a message, select **View details** in the **Actions** column.

The **Message details** page displays extended information for your selected message. You can view the contents of the message, files attached to the message, the message creation time stamp, and so on.&#x20;
