# Configure Recipients

Configuring recipients for your notification emails is necessary so you can start receiving timely updates about specific events in your account.&#x20;

Account administrators can define recipients for a [notification category](./#notification_types). Recipients include specific users as well as a group of users who will be informed when a certain event is triggered. For example, if subscription-related notifications are enabled, the appropriate recipients will receive an alert when a subscription is updated.&#x20;

Administrators can also manage recipients for an email notification by adding new ones or removing existing ones.

## Adding recipients

Follow these steps to add individual users and groups to your email notifications:

1. Navigate to the **Notifications** page (**Settings** > **Notifications**).&#x20;
2. On the **Subscribers** tab, select the relevant category. For example, to configure recipients for your order-related notifications, select **Orders**.
3. On the subscriber details page, select the **Recipients** tab.

4. Define the recipients for your notifications:
   * To add users, click **Edit** in the **Users** section and select all users who should receive notification emails. Only active users are displayed in this list. If the user you wish to add is not displayed, make sure they are [added to your account](../users/add-new-users.md).
   * To add groups, click **Edit** in the **Groups** section and select the required groups. You can select multiple groups.&#x20;
5. Select **Save**. Your list of recipients is updated.&#x20;

## Removing recipients

You can manage your recipients using the **Edit** option on the **Recipients** tab.

* To remove a user, clear the checkbox next to that user and save your changes.
