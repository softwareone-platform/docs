# Configure Recipients

Configuring recipients for your notifications is necessary so you can start receiving emails about the events in your account.&#x20;

Account administrators can configure new recipients for a [notification category](./#notification_types) and manage the existing ones. Recipients include individual users in your account or a group of users who must be notified about specific events.&#x20;

Once configured, the platform starts sending notifications to your chosen recipients. For example, if you set up recipients for subscription-related notifications, they'll receive an alert when a subscription is updated or nearing expiration.&#x20;

Administrators can also manage existing recipients by adding new users or groups and removing the existing ones.

## Configuring recipients for notifications

Follow these steps to configure users and groups for your email notifications:

1. From the main menu, go to **Settings** > **Notifications** and select the **Configuration** tab.&#x20;
2. Select the notification category for which you wish to configure recipients. For example, to configure recipients for order-related notifications, select **Orders**.
3. On the details page of your selected category, select the **Recipients** tab.

4. Do the following as required:
   * **Adding users** - Click **Edit** in the **Users** section and select the users who should receive notification emails. Note that only active users are displayed in this list. If the user you wish to add is not displayed, ensure they are [added to your account](../users/add-new-users.md).
   * **Adding groups -** Click **Edit** in the **Groups** section and select the required groups. You can select multiple groups.&#x20;
5. **Save** your changes. The updated list of recipients is displayed on the page.&#x20;

## Removing existing recipients

To manage your list, select the required **Edit** option on the **Recipients** tab.

* To remove a user, uncheck the checkbox next to that user and save your changes.
