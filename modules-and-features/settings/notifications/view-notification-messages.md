# View Notification Messages

Account administrators can use the **Messages** tab to view all notification emails triggered for the users in their account.&#x20;

The list includes messages that were sent successfully, as well as those that could not be delivered. You can filter messages to view only those you are interested in. See [Customize the Data Grid](../../../marketplace-platform/platform-overview/preferences-and-settings/customize-the-data-grid.md) to learn more.&#x20;

For each message, you can view details, including the message ID, the email address of the recipient, their user ID on the platform, the timestamp of when the message was created, the status of the message, and more.

Note that the **Contact** column displays the recipient's email address, while the **Users** column displays the name and ID of the individual associated with that contact. If the **Users** column is empty, it means the recipient doesn't have an account on the platform.

## Viewing message details

To view the full details of a message, select **View details** in the **Actions** column on the **Messages** tab.

The **Message details** page provides extended information about your selected message. Use the tabs to view the contents of the message, attached files, and other details, like the date and time when the message was sent.&#x20;
