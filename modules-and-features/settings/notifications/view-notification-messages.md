The list includes messages that were sent successfully, as well as those that couldn't be delivered. You can filter messages to view only those you are interested in. See [Customize the Data Grid](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md) to learn more.&#x20;

For each message, you can view various details, including the message ID, the email address of the recipient, their user ID on the platform, the timestamp of when the message was created, the status of the message, and more.

## Viewing message details

To view the full details of a message, select **View details** in the **Actions** column on the **Messages** tab.

The **Message details** page provides extended information about your selected message. Use the tabs to view the contents of the message, attached files, and other details, like the date and time when the message was sent.&#x20;
