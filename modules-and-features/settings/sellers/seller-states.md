# Seller States

A seller is a SoftwareOne entity (for example, SoftwareOne Canada) that buys software products from vendors (like Microsoft) and sells those products to clients and partners.

A seller can currently exist in these states: **New**, **Active**, **Offline**, **Disabled**, or **Deleted**. The following diagram shows the transitions between these states:
