# Sellers

In the Marketplace Platform, a seller refers to a SoftwareOne legal entity that is responsible for procurement, order fulfillment, and billing. Examples of such entities include SoftwareOne UK, SoftwareOne USA, and so on.

Account administrators can view all sellers on the **Sellers** page.

The page displays all sellers linked to your account by SoftwareOne, along with their details, such as name, ID, and address. You can also view the status of each seller. See [Seller States](seller-states.md) for possible values.
