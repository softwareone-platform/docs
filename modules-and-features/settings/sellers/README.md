# Sellers

In the SoftwareOne Marketplace, a seller is a legal entity within SoftwareOne that is responsible for fulfilling orders, issuing invoices, and handling billing. Examples of sellers include SoftwareOne UK, SoftwareOne USA, and more.

### Viewing sellers

Account administrators can view all sellers on the **Sellers** page.&#x20;

When you open the page, all sellers linked to your account by SoftwareOne are displayed.&#x20;

For each seller, you can view key details, such as name, ID, and address. You can also view the status. You can use the [sort and filter options](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md) to customize the list and [show or hide specific columns](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md#managing-columns) as needed.&#x20;

4. Use the following tabs to access additional related information:&#x20;

   * **Buyers** - Displays all buyers linked to the SoftwareOne seller in the account, along with the buyer's name and address. The **ERP link status** is also displayed on this tab. An ERP link is a reference to the customer record in the SoftwareOne ERP system. A **Blocked** ERP link indicates that you cannot transact with the specified seller. In such cases, [contact support](../../../help-and-support/contact-support.md) for assistance.
   * **Currencies** - Displays a list of currencies supported by the seller.
   * **Details** - Displays the log details for associated events and external IDs. You can also track when the last update occurred and when the system will perform its next synchronization with the ERP system.
   * **Audit trail** - Displays a record of events related to the seller. For more information, see [Audit Trail](../audit-trail.md).
