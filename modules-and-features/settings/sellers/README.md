# Sellers

In the Marketplace Platform, a seller refers to a SoftwareOne legal entity that is responsible for procurement, order fulfillment, and billing. Examples of such entities include SoftwareOne UK, SoftwareOne USA, and so on.

Account administrators can view all sellers on the **Sellers** page.
