# Buyers

In the Marketplace Platform, a buyer refers to any organization or legal entity that procures products or services from SoftwareOne. Buyers are the recipients of the invoices issued by SoftwareOne. See [Key Concepts](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/key-concepts.md) to learn more about buyers.

As a client, you can enable or disable a buyer, and update buyer details as needed. However, you cannot add new buyers. New buyers can be added by SoftwareOne only. &#x20;
