# Buyers

In the Marketplace Platform, a buyer refers to any organization or legal entity that procures products or services from SoftwareOne. Buyers are the recipients of the invoices issued by SoftwareOne.&#x20;

As a client, you can enable or disable a buyer and update buyer details as needed from the interface. However, you cannot add new buyers to your account. Buyers can be added by SoftwareOne only. &#x20;

Account administrators can view all buyers on the **Buyers** page in the platform. The page is available under **Settings** in the main menu.

The page shows all buyers linked to your account. For each buyer, you can view details such as the buyer's name and address, tax identifier, contact person, and more.&#x20;

You can also view the buyer's status in the system. Possible values include:

* **Enabled** - The buyer has been created in the system, but it hasn't been activated yet by SoftwareOne.
* **Active** - The buyer is active, and you can select it from your list of buyers when ordering products.
* **Disabled** - The buyer has been disabled and can no longer be selected when buying products.
* **Mismatch** - The buyerâ€™s data is not in sync with the data in our backend system. This discrepancy can occur due to various reasons. [Contact support](../../../help-and-support/contact-support.md) for assistance.

You also have action links that allow you to enable, disable, or edit the buyer. These options are visible only if you have access to the Account Management module in the platform.
