# Buyers

In the Marketplace Platform, a buyer is defined as an organization that procures products or services from SoftwareOne. Buyers are recognized as legal entities within SoftwareOne's ERP system and are the recipients of invoices issued by SoftwareOne.

Account administrators can update buyer details and enable or disable buyers. However, admins cannot add new buyers to the account. Only SoftwareOne can add buyers.&#x20;

Admins can also view all buyers on the **Buyers** page, available under **Settings** in the main navigation menu.&#x20;

For each buyer, you can view details such as the buyer's name and address, tax identifier, contact person, and more.&#x20;

You can also view buyer status with possible values, including:

* **Enabled** - Indicates that the buyer has been created in the system, but it hasn't been activated yet by SoftwareOne.
* **Active** - Indicates that the buyer is active, and you can select it from your list of buyers when ordering products.
* **Disabled** - Indicates that the buyer has been disabled, and you can no longer select it when buying products.
* **Mismatch** - Indicates that the buyerâ€™s data is not in sync with our backend system. This discrepancy can occur for several reasons. [Contact support](../../../help-and-support/contact-support.md) for assistance.

You also have action links that allow you to enable, disable, or edit the buyer. These options are visible only if you have access to the Account Management module in the platform.

## Viewing buyer details

To view the details page for a buyer, select the buyer on the **Buyers** page.&#x20;

The details page provides general information, such as the buyer's name and ID. You can also view:

* **Account** details, including the name, ID, and status.
* **SCU identifier**, which represents a unique ID for your customer card or profile within the SoftwareOne ERP system.
* **Tax number** for the buyer.

The details page also contains the following tabs:

<table><thead><tr><th width="156">Tab</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>General</strong></td><td><p>Displays the buyer's address and the contact person's details. </p><p></p><p>Note that in the Marketplace platform, the buyer's address fields must meet certain requirements.
