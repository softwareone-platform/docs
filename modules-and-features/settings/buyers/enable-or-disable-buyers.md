# Enable or Disable Buyers

If you no longer wish to use a buyer, you can disable them temporarily through the platform and re-enable them when required.&#x20;

When you disable a buyer, the licensees associated with that buyer also become unavailable. It means you'll no longer be able to select those licensees when creating a new agreement.&#x20;

## Enabling or disabling a buyer

To enable or disable a buyer:

1. Navigate to the **Buyers** page.&#x20;
2. Find the buyer you want to manage.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/BuyersPage.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Buyers page  in the platform.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

3. Select the actions icon (**•••**) for the buyer and choose **Enable** or **Disable**. Note that only one of these options is shown depending on the current state of the buyer. For example, the **Enable** option is shown only if the buyer has been disabled.&#x20;
4. In the confirmation dialog, confirm the action.

A message is displayed stating that the buyer has been updated. You can view the updated buyer status on the **Buyers** page.
