# Licensees

A licensee represents a specific person or a department within your account that receives the license to use the product.&#x20;

Licensees are linked to the buyers and sellers in your account. There can be multiple licensees in an account, however, a licensee can only be linked to one buyer and one seller. You can learn about licensees in [Key Concepts](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/key-concepts.md).

Initially, the licensees are created by SoftwareOne and mapped to the different buyers and sellers within your account. However, you can easily manage the licensees and create new ones through the interface.

## Licensee interface <a href="#agreements-interface" id="agreements-interface"></a>

Account administrators can access the **Licensees** page by selecting **Settings** > **Licensees** from the main menu.&#x20;

The page displays all licensees that exist in your account. For each licensee, you can view the following details:

* **Licensee** - Displays the name and unique identifier of the licensee. The name can be the name of a user, a company name, or a department name.
* **Address** - Displays the address of the licensee.
* **Contact person** - Displays the contact person associated with the licensee.
* **Buyer** - Displays the buyer that has been mapped to the licensee.
* **Seller** - Displays the SoftwareOne entity that is responsible for facilitating the procurement of products and licenses.
* **Status** - Displays the licensee's status in the platform. To learn about the possible states, see [Licensee States](licensee-states.md).
