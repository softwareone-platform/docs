# Licensees

A licensee is a specific person or a department within your account that receives the license to use the product.&#x20;

Licensees are connected to buyers and sellers in your account. An account can contain multiple licensees, but a licensee can only be linked to one buyer and one seller. For more information, see [Key Concepts](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/key-concepts.md).

In the SoftwareOne Marketplace, only account administrators can create and manage licensees.&#x20;

### Viewing and managing licensees

Account administrators can view and manage licensees from the **Licensees** page.&#x20;

When you open the page, all licensees within the account are displayed. For each licensee, you can view key details such as name, address, status, and more. You can use the [sort and filter options](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md) to customize the list and [show or hide specific columns](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md#managing-columns) as needed.&#x20;

The **Licensees** page also shows whether the licensee is configured as a **resale licensee**. A resale license resells products purchased through the Marketplace, instead of using them for self-consumption.&#x20;

From the **Licensees** page, you can manage licensees by updating licensee details or enabling and disabling a licensee.

On the licensee details page, you can view the extended information for your selected licensee.

To view the details page for a licensee:

1. Navigate to the **Licensees** page.
2. (Optional) Use filters to find the desired licensee.
3. Select the licensee name to view information, such as the licensee's name, marketplace ID, and status. You can also view the linked buyer and seller entities.

4. Use the following tabs to access additional related information:
   * **General** - Displays the licensee's mailing address and contact person details.&#x20;
   * **Details** - Displays date and time information for the licensee, for example, the date and time when the licensee was created in the system, and so on.
   * **Audit trail** - Displays a record of events related to the licensee. For more information, see [Audit Trail](../audit-trail.md).

### Additional actions

You can perform various actions on the **Licensees** and **Licensee details** pages. The actions available depend on the licensee's current status:

* [Create licensee](create-licensees.md)
* [Edit licensee](edit-licensees.md)
* [Enable or disable a licensee](enable-or-disable-licensees.md)
