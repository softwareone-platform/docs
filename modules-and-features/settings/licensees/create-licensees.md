# Create Licensee

You can create new licensees and map those licensees to the buyers and sellers in your account. Licensees are used when establishing agreements and ordering software products.

## Creating a licensee

Before creating a licensee, ensure that your account contains buyers and sellers. Also make sure that you have the first and last name, and email address of the licensee to add.

Follow these steps to create a new licensee:

1. On the **Licensees** page (**Settings** > **Licensee**), click **Add**. The **Add licensee** page opens.&#x20;
2. Do the following and then click **Next**:
   * **Logo** - (Optional) Add a logo representing the licensee. You can upload an image by clicking **Select file** or by dragging the image into the field.
   * **Licensee name** - (Required) Provide the licensee's name. This can be your company name, department name, or username.&#x20;
   * **External reference** - (Optional) Provide a reference number or identifier for the licensee.
   * **Licensee description** - (Optional) Add a description for the licensee.
3. Choose the buyer for your transactions. Note that you can link a licensee to one buyer only. If you have several buyers, use the **Search** bar to find the required buyer. Click **Next**.
