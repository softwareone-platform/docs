# Create Licensee

You can create new licensees and map those licensees to the buyers and sellers in your account. Licensees are used when establishing agreements and ordering software products.

Before creating a licensee, ensure that your account contains buyers and sellers. Also, make sure that you have the first and last name and email address of the licensee to add.

## Creating a licensee

1. Navigate to the **Licensees** page. Then, select **Add** to start the **Add licensee** wizard.&#x20;
2. On the **General** page, complete the following steps:&#x20;
   * **Logo** - (Optional) Add a logo representing the licensee. You can upload an image by clicking **Select file** or by dragging the image into the field.

   * **Licensee description** - (Optional) Add a description for the licensee.
3. Select **Next**. Then, on the **Buyers** page, choose the buyer for your transactions. Note that you can link a licensee to one buyer only. If you have several buyers, use the **Search** bar to find the required buyer. Select **Next**.
