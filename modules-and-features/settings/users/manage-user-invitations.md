# Manage User Invitations

After you've invited an individual to join your account, you can manage their invitation through the platform.&#x20;

For example, you can reinvite the person if they didn't receive the invitation email or have difficulty accepting your invitation. Additionally, if the person's invitation has expired, you can create a new invitation and send it to them by email.

## Reinviting a user

If the person you invited didn't receive the invitation email or has difficulty accepting your invitation, you can share the invite link with them directly or send the invitation email again.

To reinvite a user to your account:

1. Navigate to the **Users** page and find the user you wish to reinvite.
2. Select the actions icon (**•••**) and do the following:
   * **Copy invitation link** - Select to copy the invite as a link and share it directly with the individual.&#x20;
   * **Resend invitation link** - Select to resend the invitation to the user's email.

## Sending a new invitation email

If an invitation is not accepted within 7 days from the send date, it expires.&#x20;

Account administrators can create a new invitation and resend it to the individual. The option to send a new invitation is only enabled for users who have the **Invitation expired** status on the platform.

Follow these steps only if the individual's invitation has expired and they see the following message when selecting the invite link:&#x20;

If the original invitation is still valid, you can resend the original invitation or copy the invite as a link and share it with the person directly.
{% endhint %}

To send a new invitation email:

1. Navigate to the **Users** page and find the required user.
2. Select the actions icon (**•••**) and choose **Send new invitation**. A new invitation email is sent to the individual, and a confirmation message is displayed.
