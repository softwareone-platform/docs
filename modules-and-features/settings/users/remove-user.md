# Remove Users

In certain situations, you might need to remove a person from your account. If you are an account administrator, you can use the **Remove** option on the **Users** page to remove an individual.&#x20;

Before removing an individual from your account, note the following points:

* Ensure that you have reviewed the individual's permissions and assigned groups. This is necessary to prevent accidental removal.
* Removing an individual doesn't delete them from the system, allowing you to [add them to your account again](add-new-users.md).
* Removing someone only removes them from the respective account. If the individual is associated with several accounts on the platform, they can still access those accounts.&#x20;
* You cannot remove yourself from an account. The platform shows a message when you try to remove yourself.
* If you remove an individual with an **Invited** status, their invitation link no longer remains valid.
