# Edit Users

The **Edit** option on the **Users** page lets you update an individual's group membership.&#x20;

With this option, you can only modify the groups that the individual belongs to. Other details (such as name, email address, or contact details) can't be updated.&#x20;

If any of those details require updating, the individual must update them through the **My Profile** option in their profile menu. To learn more, see [Manage Your Profile](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/manage-profile.md).&#x20;

2. Find the required user. You can [use filters](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md#filter-data) to find a user based on their ID, name, email address, and other conditions.
3. Select the actions icon (**•••**) and choose **Edit** to start the **Edit user** wizard.
4. Select the **Groups** page and make the following changes as necessary:
   * To add the user to a group, select the checkbox for that group.
