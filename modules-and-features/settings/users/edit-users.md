# Edit Users

The **Edit** option on the **Users** page lets you update an individual's group membership.

With this option, you can only modify the groups that the individual belongs to. Other details (such as name, email address, or contact details) can't be updated.

If any of those details require updating, the individual must update them through the **My Profile** option in their profile menu. To learn more, see [Manage Your Profile](https://docs.platform.softwareone.com/marketplace-platform/platform-overview/preferences-and-settings/manage-profile).
