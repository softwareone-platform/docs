# Respond to Invitations

When you are invited to the Marketplace Platform by the SoftwareOne Operations team or your account administrator, you'll receive an invitation to join the account.

### Accepting an invitation <a href="#accepting-an-invitation" id="accepting-an-invitation"></a>

To accept the invitation:

1. Select the invite link in your email. The following page is displayed:

2. Select **Accept invitation**. The registration page is displayed:

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="https://docs.platform.softwareone.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.gitbook.com%2Fcontent%2FZ5DNbniz33mXCZoO62Rm%2Fblobs%2FQQiR2BACKTgZazAHC9kx%2Fimage.png&#x26;width=768&#x26;dpr=4&#x26;quality=100&#x26;sign=101d172a&#x26;sv=2" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The account registration page.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

3. On the registration page, do the following:
   1. Enter your first name and last name.
   2. Enter a new password and then confirm that your new password matches the one you entered in the **Password** field. Passwords must be at least eight characters long and must contain at least one lowercase (a-z) and one uppercase letter (A-Z), a number, and a special character. When you enter a new password, our password validation checks whether it meets the specified criteria.
   3. Select **I agree to the SoftwareOne Client Portal Terms of Use**.
   4. Select **Accept invitation**.

If single sign-on (SSO) is configured, you'll be automatically redirected to your provider to authenticate. Once authenticated, you only need to enter your first and last name.
{% endhint %}

4. Sign in to your account using your email address and password.

After signing in, you are redirected to the **Home** page, from where you can access platform modules and perform different operations depending on your group membership. To familiarize yourself with the platform navigation, see [Platform interface](https://docs.platform.softwareone.com/marketplace-platform/platform-overview/interface).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Invite link not working?**

An invitation link will not work if it has expired. Invite links are unique and must be accepted within 7 days from the send date. If your invite link has expired, the account administrator must create a new link. For instructions, see [Manage User Invitations](https://docs.platform.softwareone.com/modules-and-features/settings/users/manage-user-invitations).
{% endhint %}

### Declining an invitation <a href="#declining-an-invitation" id="declining-an-invitation"></a>

You can decline an invitation if it was sent to you in error or if you choose not to join the account.

To decline, open the invitation link and select **Decline invitation**.
