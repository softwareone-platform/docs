3. On the registration page, do the following:
   1. Enter your first name and last name.
   2. Enter a new password and then confirm that your new password matches the one you entered in the **Password** field. Passwords must be at least eight characters long and must contain at least one lowercase (a-z) and one uppercase letter (A-Z), a number, and a special character.

4. Sign in to your account using your email address and password.&#x20;

After signing in, you are redirected to the **Home** page, from where you can access platform modules and perform different operations depending on your group membership. To familiarize yourself with the platform navigation, see [Platform interface](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/).

**Invite link not working?**

An invitation link will not work if it has expired. Invite links are unique and must be accepted within 7 days from the send date. If your invite link has expired, the account administrator must create a new link. For instructions, see [Manage User Invitations](manage-user-invitations.md).
{% endhint %}

## Declining the invitation

You can decline an invitation if it was sent to you in error or if you choose not to join the account.

To decline, open the invitation link and select **Decline invitation**.
