# Sellers

In the Marketplace Platform, a seller refers to a SoftwareOne legal entity that is responsible for procurement, order fulfillment, and billing. Examples of such entities include SoftwareOne UK, SoftwareOne USA, and so on.

As an account administrator, you can access the sellers on the **Sellers** page in the platform. The page is available under **Settings** in the main menu.

The page displays all sellers linked to your account by SoftwareOne. You can view each entity's name and ID, address, and status.&#x20;

Only two status types are displayed. **Active** means that the seller is active and available for transactions in the Marketplace. **Disabled** indicates that the seller is not operational and cannot be used for transactions. However, you can still access any historical data related to the seller.&#x20;
