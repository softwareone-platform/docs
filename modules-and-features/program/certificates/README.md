# Certificates

In the Marketplace Platform, a certificate is an object that demonstrates you meet the vendor's requirements and eligibility criteria for a program.&#x20;

Holding a certificate means you are eligible to purchase products and enjoy all the benefits and incentives associated with the program.&#x20;

### Viewing certificates

To view your certificates, navigate to the **Certificates** page in the platform.&#x20;

When you launch the **Certificates** page, all certificates are displayed. This includes certificates that are awaiting approval from the vendor, as well as active, expired, and terminated certificates. You can use the [sort and filter options](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md) to customize the list and [show or hide specific columns](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md#managing-columns) as needed.

The table provides information, such as the certificate's name and ID, the name of the certificant, current status, and more.&#x20;
