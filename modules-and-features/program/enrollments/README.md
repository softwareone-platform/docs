# Enrollments

Enrollment is the process of registering for a vendor program.&#x20;

Enrollment gives you access to all the benefits and incentives associated with the program. These benefits may include reduced pricing, special offers, renewal discounts, and more. To enroll in a program, you must meet specific requirements, such as submitting necessary documentation or meeting certain criteria established by the vendor.&#x20;

In the Marketplace Platform, the enrollment process includes these steps:

1. Choosing the program you want to enroll in.
2. Providing information according to the program's parameters.&#x20;
3. Submitting your request.&#x20;

When you are enrolled, the **Enrollments** page displays the enrollment information:

The page displays all enrollments, regardless of the status. For each enrollment, you can view various details, including the enrollment ID, the program name, enrollment status, and more.
