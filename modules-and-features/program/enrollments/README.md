# Enrollments

Enrollment is the process of registering for a vendor program.&#x20;

Enrollment gives you access to all the benefits and incentives associated with the program. These benefits may include reduced pricing, special offers, renewal discounts, and more.&#x20;

To enroll in a program, you must meet specific requirements, such as submitting necessary documentation or meeting certain criteria established by the vendor. In the Marketplace Platform, the enrollment process typically includes these steps:

1. Choosing the program you want to enroll in.
2. Providing information according to the program's parameters.&#x20;
3. Submitting your request.&#x20;

When you are enrolled, the **Enrollments** page displays the enrollment information.

### Viewing enrollments

To view your enrollment, navigate to the **Enrollments** page in the platform. When you launch the **Enrollments** page, all enrollments are displayed, regardless of the status. You can use the [sort and filter options](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md) to customize the list and [show or hide specific columns](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md#managing-columns) as needed.

The table provides information, enrollment ID, the program name, enrollment status, and more.&#x20;
