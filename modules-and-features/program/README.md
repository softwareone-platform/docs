# Program

Program management in the Marketplace Platform enables SoftwareOne partners to view programs available for enrollment and request certificates for those programs. A program consists of specific requirements, and certificates are issued once these requirements are fulfilled.

To get started, see any of the following links:

{% content-ref url="programs.md" %}
[programs.md](programs.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="certificates/" %}
[certificates](certificates/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="enrollments/" %}
[enrollments](enrollments/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
