## Enrolling in a program

You can initiate the program enrollment process by selecting **Add** on the **Certificates** tab.

When you select this option, the **Add Certificates** wizard opens, enabling you to create a new enrollment request, which is submitted to the vendor for approval. See [Create New Enrollment](enrollments/create-new-enrollment.md) for details on how to create a new enrollment request.

When the enrollment is approved, you receive a certificate confirming that you meet the program's requirements and will receive benefits associated with your membership.
