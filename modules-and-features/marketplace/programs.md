# Programs

The **Programs** page in the platform shows all programs that are active and open for enrollment. When eligible partners and clients enroll in a program, they gain access to all the benefits associated with it.

Selecting a program on the **Programs** page opens a details page, where you can read more about the program to understand its purpose and requirements.

The program details page also contains a **Certificate** tab that displays all certificates you may have added for the program. You can also add a new certificate using the **Add** option on the page. For instructions, see [Add Certificate](certificates/add-certificate.md).&#x20;
