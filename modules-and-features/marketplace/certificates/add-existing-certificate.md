# Add Existing Certificate

If you are already enrolled in a program and want to add your certificate for that program to the Marketplace, you can do this through the **Certificates** page in the platform.&#x20;

Adding a certificate makes it available during the ordering process. When ordering products under a specific program, selecting the certificate will ensure that you receive the benefits that come with that program.

If you want to obtain a certificate for a program, you must first enroll in that program. For details, see [Create New Enrollment](../enrollments/create-enrollment-requests.md).
