# Certificates

Certificates management is a feature that lets you access and manage your certificates for all the programs you are enrolled in.

In the Marketplace Platform, a certificate is an object, which demonstrates that you meet the vendor's requirements and eligibility criteria for a program. Holding a certificate means you are eligible to purchase products and enjoy all benefits and incentives associated with the program.&#x20;

You can view all certificates on the **Certificates** page on the platform. This includes your pending certificates that are awaiting approval from the vendor as well as active, expired, or terminated certificates.&#x20;

Through certificates management, you can also apply for a certificate by enrolling in a program, add your existing certificate for a program, and rename a certificate for ease of identification.

## Certificates interface

You can access the **Certificates** page by selecting **Marketplace** > **Certificates** from the main menu.
