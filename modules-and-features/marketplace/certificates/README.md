# Certificates

In the Marketplace Platform, a certificate is an object that demonstrates that you meet the vendor's requirements and eligibility criteria for a program.&#x20;

Holding a certificate means you are eligible to purchase products and enjoy all benefits and incentives associated with the program.&#x20;

You can view and manage your certificates for different programs on the **Certificates** page in the platform. This includes certificates that might be awaiting approval from the vendor, as well as active, expired, or terminated certificates.&#x20;
