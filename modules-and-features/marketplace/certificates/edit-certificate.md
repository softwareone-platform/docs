# Edit Certificate

If you have multiple certificates for the same vendor program, you can choose different names for those certificates so you can easily identify them in your list of certificates.&#x20;

## Editing a certificate

Follow these steps to edit a certificate's name:

1. Navigate to the **Certificates** page (**Marketplace** > **Certificates**) on the platform.
2. Select the certificate to be renamed.&#x20;
3. On the certificate details page, click **Edit**.
4. Enter the new name and click **Save**. We recommend providing a unique name so you can easily identify the certificate.

Your certificate is renamed, and the new name is reflected in the certificates list and on the certificate's detail page.
