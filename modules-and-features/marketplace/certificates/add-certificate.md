# Add Certificate

If you are already enrolled in a program, you can add your certificate for that program to the Marketplace.&#x20;

Adding a certificate makes it available for selection during the ordering process. It means when ordering products under a specific program, selecting the certificate will ensure that you receive the benefits that come with that program.

To add your certificate, you will need your Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) ID and email address.&#x20;
