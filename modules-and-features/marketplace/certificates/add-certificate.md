# Add Certificate

If you are already enrolled in a program and want to add your certificate for that program to the Marketplace, you can do this through the **Certificates** page in the platform.&#x20;

Adding a certificate makes it available during the ordering process. When ordering products under a specific program, selecting the certificate will ensure that you receive the benefits that come with that program.

To enroll in a program, you will need your Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) ID and email address.&#x20;
