## Statements <a href="#whats-a-statement" id="whats-a-statement"></a>

A billing statement provides a detailed view of your invoice data. Statements are generated as Excel files, and they contain the following tabs:&#x20;

* **Summary** - Contains different objects associated with the statement, such as agreement, licensee, and orders. The page also contains links that you can use to access these objects directly in the platform.
* **Charges** - Contains a list of charges and subscriptions for the billing period. You can also view all items within the subscription, their quantities, and prices. If [split billing](split-billing/) has been enabled, the subscription allocation percentage and estimated license count (ELC) details are also displayed.&#x20;
* **Orders** - Contains all orders placed during the billing period and their corresponding details, such as the type of order, the date when the order was placed, and more.
