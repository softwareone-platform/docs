# Understand Your Billing Documents

Your billing documents, like an invoice or statement, contain important information about your transactions.

To help you understand these documents better, we've created the following video. It breaks down the key sections within your invoices and statements and highlights important aspects to be aware of when interpreting the charges.

## Statements <a href="#whats-a-statement" id="whats-a-statement"></a>

A billing statement provides a detailed view of your invoice data. Statements are generated as Excel files, and they contain the following tabs:&#x20;

* **Summary** - Contains different objects associated with the statement, such as agreement, licensee, and orders. The page also contains links that you can use to access these objects directly in the platform.
* **Charges** - Contains a list of charges and subscriptions for the billing period. You can also view all items within the subscription, their quantities, and prices. If [split billing](split-billing/) has been enabled, the subscription allocation percentage and estimated license count (ELC) details are also displayed.&#x20;
* **Orders** - Contains all orders placed during the billing period and their corresponding details, such as the type of order, the date when the order was placed, and more.

You can download a sample statement from the [Billing ](./)page.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs) <a href="#invoice-faq" id="invoice-faq"></a>

### How do I display a purchase order number on the invoice?&#x20;

You can include a purchase order number by entering it in the **Additional ID** field, located on the **Details** tab within the agreement details page. For more information, see [How can I enter a purchase order number?](../../../help-and-support/faqs/how-do-you-handle-purchase-order-numbers-in-subscription-based-models.md#client-guidance-on-po-numbers-and-invoices) and [Update Additional Client ID](../agreements/edit-agreement-id.md).

### Can I view or download my statements?

Yes, you can view or download your billing statements from the **Attachments** tab on the agreement details page. For more information, see [Viewing and downloading attachments](../agreements/view-and-download-attachments.md#viewing-and-downloading-attachments).

### Why are all the subscription invoice lines marked as 'Qty 1'?

Vendors generate hundreds or thousands of charges during a billing period, and all charges can't be listed individually on the invoice PDF.&#x20;

To avoid clutter, we consolidate all charges at the item level and display the quantity as '1' on the invoice. You can view the quantity data and full set of charges in your [billing statement](./#whats-a-statement).
