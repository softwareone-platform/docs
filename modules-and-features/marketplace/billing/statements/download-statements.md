If you cannot access your account, you can still download your statement from the [Billing Statement Download](https://mystatements.platform.softwareone.com/) page. This page is publicly available, allowing you to download your statement using your unique invoice ID and statement ID.

To download your statement:

1. Open your invoice. Then, note down the statement ID and invoice ID.
