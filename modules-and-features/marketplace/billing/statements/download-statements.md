# Download Statements

Statements are available for download in XLSX format.

Each statement includes a detailed breakdown of charges for the specified billing period. Each charge highlights transactions related to the subscriptions in your agreement. Use the list of charges in your statement to fully understand your invoice.&#x20;

Note that the charges listed in your statement might not include taxes, such as VAT or sales tax. These taxes are calculated separately and then applied to your final invoice.
