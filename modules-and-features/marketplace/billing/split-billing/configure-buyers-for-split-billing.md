# Configure Buyers for Split Billing

When split billing is activated, the platform assigns 100% of the billing to the default buyer in your agreement, known as the **Owner** buyer.&#x20;

You can configure additional buyers and distribute subscription costs across those buyers using the **Edit** option on the agreement details page.&#x20;

## Configuring buyers for split billing

When selecting buyers, there's no limit to the number of buyers you can select, meaning you can choose as many buyers as necessary to divide costs effectively.&#x20;

To configure buyers:

1. Open the details page of your agreement. Make sure that [split billing has been activated](../#activate-split-billing) for the agreement.&#x20;
2. On the **Split billing** tab, select **Edit**.&#x20;

3. In the **Split billing** dialog, select the buyers you wish to add. You can only select buyers who are linked to the seller of this agreement. Additionally, the **Owner** buyer is selected by default, and you can't change it.&#x20;

4. Select **Save**. Your newly added buyers are displayed on the **Split billing** tab in your agreement.
