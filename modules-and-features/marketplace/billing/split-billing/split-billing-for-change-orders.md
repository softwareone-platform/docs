# Split Billing for Change Orders

In the Marketplace Platform, change orders are created when you add more licenses to your subscription and submit the order.&#x20;

If split billing is active for the agreement under which you are ordering additional licenses, you can select buyers and assign billing to those buyers when placing the order.

Note that this method of split billing only works for certain products in the platform.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To split billing when ordering additional licenses using an existing agreement:

1. Navigate to the **Subscriptions** page. Then, select the desired subscription.
2. On the subscription details page, select **Edit**. Ensure that [split billing is activated](../#activate-split-billing) for the agreement and that [buyers are configured](configure-buyers-for-split-billing.md).
3. Under **New Qty**, enter the new quantity, then select **Next**.&#x20;

4. In the **Split billing** step, select the buyer to whom you want to allocate billing.&#x20;
   * Select a buyer from the list to allocate billing according to the percentage you have set for the buyer.&#x20;
   * Choose **None** to allocate billing based on the configured split percentages for this subscription.
