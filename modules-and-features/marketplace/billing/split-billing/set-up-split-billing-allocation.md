# Set Up Split Billing Allocation

If you have [configured buyers](configure-buyers-for-split-billing.md), but have not defined the split breakdown yet, 100% of the subscription billing is allocated to the **Owner** buyer in your agreement.&#x20;

You can update the split to include additional buyers and allocate billing to those buyers. There are two ways to do this. You can configure the allocation from the subscription details page or the agreement details page.

### Configuring split billing (from the subscription details page)

The **Split billing** tab on the subscription details page displays the allocation for all buyers and allows you to divide the billing across different buyers in your account.

To set up allocations:&#x20;

1. On the **Split billing** tab, select **Edit**. The **Edit** **split billing** dialog opens.

The updated split details are displayed on the **Split billing** tab of your subscription.

### Configuring split billing (from the agreement details page)

The **Split billing** tab within the agreement details page displays the allocation for your assigned buyers. Use the **Details** option for each buyer to adjust the billing percentage or the estimated license count.

To split the billing:

1. On the **Agreements** page, select the required agreement. Ensure that [split billing is activated](../#activate-split-billing), and [buyers are configured](configure-buyers-for-split-billing.md).
2. Select the **Split billing** tab. Your selected buyers are displayed.&#x20;
3. Select the **Details** option for the buyer for whom you want to update the allocation.&#x20;

5. In **Edit split details**, choose whether you want to update the allocation % or the estimated license count. The **allocation %** option is selected by default, but you select **ELC** if required.
   1. **Allocation %** - Select this option to split the subscription billing based on the percentage. For example, you can split the total allocation percentage of 100% between two buyers as 30% and 70% respectively.
   2. **ELC** - Select this option to split the billing based on the license count. For example,  if you have 12 subscription licenses, you can split these between two buyers as 8 and 4 licenses, respectively.
6. Enter a value based on the split percentage or license count and click **Save**. Make sure that 100% of billing or all licenses are allocated. Otherwise, the platform displays a message.
