# Set Up Split Billing Allocation

If you have [configured buyers](configure-buyers-for-split-billing.md), but have not defined the split breakdown yet, 100% of the subscription billing is allocated to the **Owner** buyer in your agreement.&#x20;

You can update the split to include additional buyers and allocate billing to those buyers. There are two ways to configure the split.

**Method 1 - Using the Edit option on the subscription details page**

The updated split details are displayed on the **Split billing** tab of your subscription.

## Method 2 - Agreement details page &#x20;

The **Split billing** tab within the agreement details page displays the allocation for your assigned buyers. Use the **Details** option for each buyer to adjust the billing percentage or the estimated license count.

Follow these steps to split the billing:

1. On the **Agreements** page, select the required agreement. Make sure that [split billing is activated](../#activate-split-billing) and [buyers are configured](configure-buyers-for-split-billing.md).
2. Select the **Split billing** tab. Your selected buyers are displayed.&#x20;
3. Click the **Details** option for the buyer for which you want to update the allocation.&#x20;

5. In **Edit split details**, choose whether you want to update the allocation % or the estimated license count. The **allocation %** option is selected by default, but you select **ELC** if required.
   1. **Allocation %** - Select this option to split the subscription billing based on the percentage. For example, you can split the total allocation percentage of 100% between two buyers as 30% and 70% respectively.
   2. **ELC** - Select this option to split the billing based on the license count. For example,  if you have 12 subscription licenses you can split these between two buyers as 8 and 4 licenses respectively.
6. Enter a value based on the split percentage or license count and click **Save**. Make sure that 100% of billing or all licenses are allocated. Otherwise, the platform displays a message.
