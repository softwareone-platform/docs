# Billing

The **Billing** module within the Marketplace Platform is your primary entry point for accessing billing documents for your account.

The module simplifies financial management by allowing you to view and download your invoices. You can also access your financial statements, containing a detailed list of charges and your orders. Additionally, you can use the **Billing** module to access and manage your credit memos.

Before starting, we recommend reading [Understand Your Billing Documents](../../billing/understand-your-billing-documents/). This page provides an overview of billing documents and explains how your Marketplace invoices and statements are structured and how to interpret them correctly.

To get started, see the following links:

{% content-ref url="invoices/" %}
[invoices](invoices/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../inventory/orders.md" %}
[orders.md](../../inventory/orders.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="statements.md" %}
[statements.md](statements.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="split-billing/" %}
[split-billing](split-billing/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
