# Billing

The **Billing** module within the Marketplace Platform is your primary entry point for accessing billing documents for your account.

The module simplifies financial management by allowing you to view and download your invoices. You can also access your financial statements, containing a detailed list of charges and your orders. Additionally, you can use the **Billing** module to access and manage your credit memos.
