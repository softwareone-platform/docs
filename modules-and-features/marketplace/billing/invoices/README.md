# Invoices

An invoice is a billing document you receive at the end of your billing period.&#x20;

Invoices contain a summary of charges and other details associated with your account. Invoice PDFs also include subscription details and the consolidated charges for all items within the subscription. See [Understand Your Billing Documents](../understand-your-billing-documents.md) to learn more.

In the Marketplace Platform, you can view your invoices on the **Invoices** page. The page is available under **Billing** in the main menu.

The page displays different properties associated with the invoice, such as invoice type, status, and more. Two types of invoices are available, including debit and credit.&#x20;

* A debit invoice includes a summary of charges and the total payable amount.&#x20;
* A credit invoice is generated when there are negative charges due to refunds or returns. Credit memos have a negative total but are still linked to a statement.
