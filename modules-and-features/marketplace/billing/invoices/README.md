# Invoices

An invoice is a billing document you receive at the end of your billing period.&#x20;

Invoices contain a summary of charges and other details associated with your account. Invoice PDFs also include subscription details and the consolidated charges for all items within the subscription. See [Understand Your Billing Documents](../../../billing/understand-your-billing-documents/) to learn more.

In the Marketplace Platform, you can view your invoices on the **Invoices** page. The page is available under **Billing** in the main navigation menu.

The main **Invoices** page displays a list of invoices and properties associated with each invoice, such as invoice ID, the total amount due, the date of issue, and the due date. The page also displays invoice status, including:&#x20;

* **Paid** - Indicates that the invoice has been paid in full. No further action is required.
* **Overdue** - Indicates that the invoice is past due. Invoices in this state require immediate action to prevent service disruptions. Note that overdue invoices may attract penalties, interest, or both, depending on your terms and conditions.
* **Issued** - Indicates that the invoice has been issued, but it hasn't been settled yet.
