# Invoices

An invoice is a billing document you receive at the end of your billing period.&#x20;

Invoices contain a summary of charges and other details associated with your account. Invoice PDFs also include subscription details and the consolidated charges for all items within the subscription. See [Understand Your Billing Documents](../understand-your-billing-documents.md) to learn more.

In the Marketplace Platform, you can view your invoices on the **Invoices** page. The page is available under **Billing** in the main menu.

The page displays different properties associated with your invoice, such as invoice type, status, date when it was created, and more. Two types of invoices are available, including debit and credit.&#x20;

* A debit invoice includes a summary of charges and the total payable amount.&#x20;
* A credit invoice is generated for negative charges due to refunds or returns. Although credit memos have a negative total, they are still linked to a billing statement.

## Viewing invoice details <a href="#subscription-details" id="subscription-details"></a>

To view the details page of an invoice, select the invoice ID on the **Invoices** page.&#x20;

At the top of the details page, you can view links to the business objects associated with the invoice. You can also view the invoice ID, status, and the currency you have been invoiced in. The invoice amount is also displayed in the same section.

The invoice details page also contains tabs that provide additional information. The following table lists these tabs:
