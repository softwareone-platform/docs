# Invoices

In the Marketplace Platform, an invoice is the final billing document you receive for your purchases.&#x20;

Although the platform manages subscription details, usage, and statements, the actual invoice is generated in our ERP system. After it is generated, the invoice is synchronized with the platform so you can perform the following tasks:

* View the invoice total showing various amounts, including net, tax, and gross.
* Download a PDF of the invoice.
* Check your invoice's status to determine if has been generated or paid.&#x20;
* Identify the agreement or statement associated with the invoice.

## Invoices interface

You can access the Invoice page by selecting **Billing** > **Invoice** from the main menu.

The **Invoices** page displays all invoices for your account. For each invoice, you can view the following details:

* **ID** - Displays the unique ID assigned to the invoice by the platform.
* Type - Displays the type of invoice:&#x20;
  * **Debit** -&#x20;
  * **Credit** - A credit type is the inverse of an invoice when there are negative charges (such as refunds and returns). Credit memos have a negative total or reduce a past invoice. They can still be tied to a Statement ID.
* **Buyer** -
* **Vendor** -
* **Product** -
* **Agreement** -
* **Seller** -&#x20;
* **Created** - Displays the date when the invoice was created.
* **SP** - Displays the total amount of the invoice.
* **Status** - Displays the invoice's status.
