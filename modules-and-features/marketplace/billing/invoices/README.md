# Invoices

An invoice is a billing document you receive at the end of your billing period.&#x20;

Invoices contain a summary of charges and other details associated with your account. Invoice PDFs also include subscription details and the consolidated charges for all items within the subscription. To learn more about invoices and how they are structured, see [Understand Your Billing Documents](../../../billing/understand-your-billing-documents/).

### Viewing invoices

To view your invoices, navigate to the **Invoices** page.&#x20;

When you launch the **Invoices** page, all invoices in your account are displayed. For each invoice, you can view properties such as invoice ID, total amount due, date of issue, and due date. Additionally, you can view invoice status, including:&#x20;

* **Paid** - Indicates that the invoice has been paid in full. No further action is required.
* **Overdue** - Indicates that the invoice is past due. Invoices in this state require immediate action to prevent service disruptions. Note that overdue invoices may attract penalties, interest, or both, depending on your terms and conditions.
* **Issued** - Indicates that the invoice has been issued, but it hasn't been settled yet.
