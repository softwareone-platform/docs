# View and Download Invoices

The Marketplace Platform provides two options for accessing your invoices:

* You can view all invoices on the **Invoices** page and individual invoices on the Invoice details page.
* You can download the invoice as a PDF from the invoice details page.

Invoices contain the following information:

* Details like your invoice ID, invoice date, and address.
* Subscriptions linked to the agreement and all items within each subscription.
* Split billing allocation, if any.
* Charges, like the unit price, VAT %, and total payable amount.

## Viewing and downloading an invoice

To view and download an invoice:

1. From the main menu, navigate to **Billing** and then select **Invoices**.
2. On the **Invoices** page, refine your list of invoices. Invoices can be filtered using the filters. You can filter by invoice type, status, amount, and so on. To learn more, see [Filter data](../../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md#filter-data).
3. Select the invoice in the **ID** field. The details page of your selected invoice opens.
4. Select the **Attachments** tab. Then, under **Actions**, select **Download**. The invoice will be downloaded to your system.
