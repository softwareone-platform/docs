# View and Download Invoices

The Marketplace Platform provides the following options for accessing your invoices:

* You can view all invoices on the **Invoices** page on the platform.

An invoice PDF contains the following information:

* Details like your invoice ID, invoice date, and address.
* Subscriptions that are linked to the agreement and all items within each subscription.
* Split billing allocation, if any.
* Charges, like the unit price, VAT%, and total payable amount.
