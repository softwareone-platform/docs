# Invoice States

Invoices can have one of the following statuses in the Marketplace Platform:

<table><thead><tr><th width="260">Status</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Paid</strong> </td><td>The invoice has been paid in full. No further action is required.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Overdue</strong></td><td>The invoice is past due. Invoices in this state require immediate action to prevent service disruptions. Note that overdue invoices may attract penalties, interest, or both, depending on your terms and conditions.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Generated</strong> </td><td>The invoice has been generated and issued, but it has not been settled yet.</td></tr></tbody></table>
