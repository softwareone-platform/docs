# Statements

A statement is a billing document you receive at the end of your billing period, along with your invoice PDF.

Statements are provided in the XLSX format and contain a detailed view of your invoice data, including individual charges, subscriptions, and orders for the billing period.&#x20;

You can view your billing statements on the **Statements** page in the platform.

The page shows all statements generated for your account and properties, such as statement ID, the total amount due, status, and more.&#x20;

For each statement, you can also view the type. A **Debit** type means that the total amount is positive or zero, and a **Credit** type means that the total amount is negative.
