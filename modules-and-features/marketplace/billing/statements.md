# Statements

A statement is a billing document you receive at the end of your billing period, along with your invoice PDF.

Statements are provided in the XLSX format and contain a detailed view of your invoice data, including individual charges, subscriptions, and orders for the billing period.&#x20;

### Viewing statements

To view your invoices, navigate to the **Statements** page.&#x20;

When you launch the **Statements** page, all statements generated for your account are displayed along with properties, such as statement ID, the total amount due, status, and more.&#x20;

For each statement, you can also view the type. A **Debit** type means that the total amount is positive or zero, and a **Credit** type means that the total amount is negative.
