# Requests

A request in the Marketplace Platform represents a pre-sale inquiry. This can include queries about products, subscriptions, pricing, billing, product availability, and more.

Client account users can create new requests through the **Products** page and track existing queries through the **Requests** page. The page displays all requests, including requests that are raised by other members in your account.&#x20;

## Requests interface

To access the **Requests** page from the main menu, select **Marketplace** > **Requests**.
