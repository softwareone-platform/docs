# Requests

A request in the Marketplace Platform represents a pre-sale inquiry. This can include queries about products, subscriptions, pricing, billing, product availability, and more.

Client account users can create new requests through the **Products** page and track existing queries through the **Requests** page. The page displays all requests, including requests that are raised by other members in your account.&#x20;

You can view and manage your requests from the **Requests** page in the platform.
