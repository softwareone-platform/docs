# Requests

A request in the Marketplace Platform represents a pre-sale inquiry. This can include queries about products, subscriptions, pricing, billing, product availability, and more.

As a client, you can create new queries through the **Products** page and track your existing queries through the **Requests** page. The page displays all requests, including requests that are raised by other members of your account.&#x20;

## Requests interface

You can access the **Requests** page by selecting **Marketplace** > **Requests** from the main menu.&#x20;
