# Change Your Request's Status to Processing

When you update your request, for example, by attaching documents, it's important to change the request status to **Processing** and send the request back to the vendor. This action informs the vendor that you've replied to their query and the request is now ready for their review.&#x20;

Before changing the status of your request, note the following points:

* You can change the status of your request to **Processing** only if the current status is **Querying**. If the request is already in **Processing** or **Completed** state, the option to change the status is unavailable.&#x20;
* Only change the status of your request to **Processing** once you've provided all the information and the request is ready for the vendor's review.

2. Make changes as necessary and then click **Process**.&#x20;

The status of your request changes from **Querying** to **Processing**. If you added comments in the **Process request** dialog, your comments are displayed and visible to everyone on the **Activity** tab.&#x20;
