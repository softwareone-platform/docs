# Add or Remove File Attachments

You can attach a file to your request at any time, regardless of the request's status. You can also delete any files you have previously added.&#x20;

Make sure that the file you want to upload is in one of these formats: `.pdf`, `.pptx`, `.doc`, or `.xlsx`.

## Adding an attachment&#x20;

Follow these steps to add a file to your request:&#x20;

1. On the **Requests** page (**Marketplace** > **Requests**), click the required request. The request details page is displayed.
2. Select the **Attachments** tab and click **Add**.&#x20;

   1. In the **Name** field, provide a file name.
   2. In the **Description** field, add a brief description of the file you are adding.&#x20;
   3. In the **Upload files** area, upload the file from your system or drag the file to the selection area.
4. Click **Add**. The file is added to the request and displayed on the **Attachments** tab.

## Editing or deleting an attachment

To edit or delete an attachment, go to the same **Attachment** tab where you originally added the file. Click the actions icon (•••) next to the file, and then select either **Edit** or **Delete** as needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
A deleted file cannot be recovered.
{% endhint %}

If you choose **Edit**, upload the new attachment in the **Edit Attachment** section, and save your changes.

If you choose **Delete**, a confirmation message will appear. Click **Delete** in this message to confirm the action.
