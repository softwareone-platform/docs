# Add or Remove File Attachments

You can attach a file to your request at any time, regardless of the request's status. You can also delete any files you have previously added.&#x20;

Make sure that the file you want to upload is in one of these formats: `.pdf`, `.pptx`, `.doc`, or `.xlsx`.

   1. In the **Name** field, provide a file name.
   2. In the **Description** field, add a brief description of the file you are adding.&#x20;
   3. In the **Upload files** area, upload the file from your system or drag the file to the selection area.
4. Select **Add**. The file is added to the request and displayed on the **Attachments** tab.

## Editing or deleting an attachment

To edit or delete an attachment, go to the same **Attachment** tab where you originally added the file. Select the actions icon (•••) next to the file, and then select **Edit** or **Delete** as needed.
