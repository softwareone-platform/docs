# Subscriptions

A subscription refers to the ongoing service provision under the terms and conditions of an agreement. In the SoftwareOne Marketplace Platform, subscriptions are mapped to agreements, and each agreement can contain one or multiple subscriptions.&#x20;

You can [order new subscriptions through the platform](../../../help-and-support/faqs/buy-products-and-services.md) and also manage licenses for your existing subscriptions. This includes ordering additional licenses and canceling the previously purchased ones.&#x20;

### Viewing subscriptions

To view your subscriptions, navigate to the **Subscriptions** page. When you launch the **Subscriptions** page, all existing subscriptions in your account are displayed.&#x20;

On this page, you can view key properties for each subscription, including the subscription name,  renewal date, and status. The page also contains a **Buy more** option, giving you quick access to the [Products ](../../catalog/products.md)page for ordering new subscriptions.
