# Subscriptions

A subscription refers to the ongoing service provision under the terms and conditions of an agreement. In the Marketplace Platform, subscriptions are mapped to agreements, and each agreement can contain one or multiple subscriptions.&#x20;

You can [order new subscriptions through the platform](buy-products-and-services.md) and also manage your existing licenses. This includes ordering additional licenses and canceling the previously purchased ones.&#x20;

Your subscriptions are available on the **Subscriptions** page. The page is available under **Marketplace** in the main menu.

On the **Subscriptions** page, you can view the key properties for each of the subscriptions, including the renewal date and status.

The **Subscriptions** page also contains a **Buy more** option, which gives you quick access to the [Products ](../products.md)page for browsing the catalog and ordering more subscriptions.
