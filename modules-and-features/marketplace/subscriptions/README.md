# Subscriptions

A subscription refers to the ongoing service provision under the terms and conditions of an agreement. Subscriptions are mapped to agreements and each agreement can contain one or multiple subscriptions.&#x20;

You can [order new subscriptions through the platform](buy-products-and-services.md) and also manage your existing licenses through the interface, including purchasing additional licenses and canceling the previously purchased ones. The **Subscriptions** page in the platform is your entry point to accessing your subscriptions.&#x20;

## Subscriptions interface

You can access the **Subscriptions** page by selecting **Marketplace** > **Subscriptions** from the main menu.
