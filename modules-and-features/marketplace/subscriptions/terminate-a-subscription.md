# Terminate Subscriptions

Subscriptions can be terminated if you no longer need them or if you don't want to renew them.&#x20;

As subscriptions are linked to agreements, the process for canceling a subscription varies depending on the number of active subscriptions in your agreement.

* If your agreement contains several active subscriptions and you want to cancel some, but not all, subscriptions within that agreement, you must place a termination order for the subscription. For instructions on how to place a termination order, see [Terminate subscription](terminate-a-subscription.md#terminate-subscription).
* If your agreement contains several subscriptions and you want to cancel all subscriptions, you must terminate the agreement altogether. You can terminate an agreement by placing a termination order. For instructions on terminating an agreement, see [Terminate Agreement](../agreements/terminate-agreements.md).&#x20;

### Terminating a subscription

Before terminating your subscriptions, note the following points:

* You can only terminate subscriptions in the **Active** state. Subscriptions in [any other state](subscription-states.md) cannot be terminated.
* Creating a termination order through the platform doesn't guarantee the cancellation of your subscription. All termination orders are sent to the vendors for approval. Subscriptions are terminated only after approval by the vendor.

To terminate a subscription:

1. Navigate to the **Subscriptions** page.
2. Select the subscription you want to terminate.
3.
