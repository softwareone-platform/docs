# Set Querying Orders to Processing

In some cases, you may need to provide additional information if your order information is incorrect or incomplete, or if specific steps must be completed before we can process your order.

Orders that require your attention are shown as **Querying**. When you open a querying order, the **General** tab on the details page shows what needs to be corrected and how to address the issue.

Once you have completed the necessary steps, you must update the order's status from **Querying to Processing**. Changing the status informs SoftwareOne and the vendor that the order is ready for their review and further processing.&#x20;

## Setting a Querying order to Processing

To move an order from **Querying** to **Processing**:

1. Navigate to the **Orders** page.
2. Select the desired purchase order in the **Querying** state. If you have several orders, use the [search bar](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/#search) or [filters](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/marketplace-for-clients/how-to-filter-your-orders.md) to quickly locate your order.
3. On the **General** tab, review the action required message. The following example message indicates that there's an issue with the parameters, and they must be updated using the **Parameters** tab.

4. Take the action as necessary, then select **Process**. Note that this button becomes available only after you have addressed the issue.

Your order's status changes to **Processing**, and the **Process** option becomes unavailable again.

If certain issues require completion outside the Marketplace Platform, such as accepting a SoftwareOne relationship request for CSP orders, you must complete the request and return to the order details page to update the order status to **Processing**.&#x20;
