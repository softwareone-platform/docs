# Orders

The Marketplace Platform supports various types of orders, including:

* **Purchase orders** - A purchase order is created when you buy a new product or service by establishing a new agreement.
* **Change orders** - A change order is created when you modify the number of licenses for a subscription, for example, when you order additional licenses or reduce the quantity of current ones.
* **Terminate order** - A termination order is created when you want to end an active subscription or agreement.&#x20;
* **Configuration order** - A configuration order is created when you want to enable or disable the auto-renewal of a subscription.

### Viewing orders

To view your orders, navigate to the **Orders** page. When you launch the **Orders** page, all orders in your account are displayed.&#x20;

For each order, you can view information, such as the order number, linked agreement, product name, estimated sales price, status, and more. You can use the [sorting and filtering options](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md) to customize the list and [show or hide specific columns](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md#managing-columns) as needed.

For more information, see [How to Filter Orders](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/marketplace-for-clients/how-to-filter-your-orders.md).
