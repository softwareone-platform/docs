# Orders

In the Marketplace Platform, an order represents a request to buy a new product, change the number of licenses, terminate a subscription, or terminate an agreement.&#x20;

There are different types of orders in the Marketplace Platform:

* **Purchase orders** - An order to buy a new product or service by establishing a new agreement.
* **Change orders** - An order to change the quantity, such as downsizing the quantity of licenses or ordering additional licenses.
* **Terminate order** - An order to terminate an active subscription or an agreement.&#x20;
* **Configuration order** - An order to enable or disable the auto-renewal of a subscription.

You can view and manage your orders from the **Orders** page in the platform. The page is available under **Marketplace** in the main menu.
