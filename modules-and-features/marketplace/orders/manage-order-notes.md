# Manage Order Notes

The **Notes** tab on the order details page shows the notes you may have entered during the ordering process.&#x20;

Once the order is created, you can update the notes as needed and add new ones if they weren't included when you placed the order.&#x20;

Notes can be updated for orders in the **Processing**, **Querying**, and **Draft** states only. For a description of these states, see [Order States](order-states.md).

1. On the **Orders** page (**Marketplace** > **Orders**), select the required order. The details page of your selected order opens.
