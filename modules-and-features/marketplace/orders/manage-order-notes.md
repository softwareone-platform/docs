# Add or Update Order Notes

When ordering a product, the Marketplace Platform provides an option to add comments or instructions, allowing you to include information that you may want to link to the order.

After the order is submitted, any notes you entered are displayed on the **Notes** tab within the order details page. If you need to update these notes, you can use the **Edit** option on the **Notes** tab. You can also use the same option to add new notes if you didn't add them when the order was originally placed.

Notes can be added or updated at any time, regardless of the order's status.

## Managing your order notes

To add or update the notes for an order:

1. Navigate to the **Orders** page, then select the desired order.
