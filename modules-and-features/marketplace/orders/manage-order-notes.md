# Manage Order Notes

The **Notes** tab on the order details page displays any notes you may have entered during the ordering process. After the order is created, you can update these notes as needed and add new ones if they not included when you placed the order.&#x20;

1. Navigate to the **Orders** page (**Marketplace** > **Orders**) and select the relevant order. The details page of your selected order opens.
2. On the **Notes** tab, click **Edit**.&#x20;
