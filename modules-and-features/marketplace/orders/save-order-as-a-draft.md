# Save Your Order as a Draft

In the Marketplace Platform, draft orders allow you to save the order configuration when you are creating an order. You can save different types of orders as a draft when creating the order.

Once you save an order as a draft, you can return to it anytime to complete the ordering process. Saved draft orders are displayed on the **Orders** page with a **Draft** status.

## Saving a purchase order as a draft

To save your order as a draft during the ordering process:

1. Navigate to the **Products** page and select the product you want to buy.
2. On the product details page, select **Buy now** to start the purchase wizard.
3. In the purchase wizard, complete all the steps as needed until you reach the **Details** page.
4. On the **Details** page, select **Save order**. Your order is saved as a draft.

## Saving a change order as a draft

A change order represents an order to change subscription quantities. Change orders are placed when you adjust the quantity of your subscription licenses. This includes upsizing as well as downsizing.&#x20;

When creating a change order, you can save it as a draft and submit it later.&#x20;

To save a change order as a draft:

1. Navigate to the **Subscriptions** page, then select an active subscription.
2. On the subscription details page, select **Edit** to start the **Edit subscription** wizard.&#x20;
3. On the **Items** page, adjust the quantity as needed and select **Next**.
4. On the **Details** page, select **Save order**. Your draft order is saved.&#x20;

You can either save the same order as a draft again or proceed to place the order. Draft orders can be updated and saved as many times as needed.

If a draft order is no longer required, [you can also delete it](delete-draft-orders.md). Once a draft order has been placed, it's no longer listed as a draft.
