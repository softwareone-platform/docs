# Order States

An order can have several states from the time it is created in the Marketplace Platform until its completion.&#x20;

The following diagram shows how an order's state can change during its lifecycle:

These states are displayed as **Status** on the **Orders** page. They are also displayed beside the order number on the details page.&#x20;

Note that the Marketplace Platform supports various account types, including vendor and client, so depending on your account type, only some states might be visible to you.

<table><thead><tr><th width="140">State</th><th>Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Draft</strong></td><td><p>The order has been saved as a draft during the ordering process. </p><p></p><p>Draft purchase orders can be accessed through the <strong>Orders</strong> page.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processing</strong></td><td>The order has been created and is currently awaiting processing by the vendor.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Querying</strong></td><td><p>The ordering parameters have been updated by the vendor. </p><p></p><p>The order now requires an action to be taken by the client account user.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Completed</strong></td><td>The order has been processed by the vendor.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Failed</strong></td><td><p>The order has been failed by the vendor or SoftwareOne. </p><p></p><p>The failure reason is shown on the <strong>General</strong> tab of the order.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Deleted</strong></td><td>The draft purchase order has been deleted by a client account user.</td></tr></tbody></table>
