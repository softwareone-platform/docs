# Agreements

An agreement is a record that establishes the terms and conditions of a transaction in the Marketplace.&#x20;

It defines the relationship between different objects, such as buyers, sellers, and licensees, and serves as the foundation for placing orders and creating subscriptions on the platform.&#x20;

You can access your agreements and manage them through the **Agreements** page. Managing implies renaming an agreement as well as changing an agreement's client ID. If you wish to terminate an agreement, you can do this by terminating all subscriptions in the agreement.&#x20;

## Agreements interface

You can access the **Agreements** page by selecting **Marketplace** > **Agreements** from the main menu.

The **Agreements** page displays all agreements that exist in your account. It also contains a **Buy more** option, which gives you quick access to the [Products ](../products.md)page.&#x20;

The agreement details page shows the agreement's name, ID, and status. Active agreements also contain a **Buy more** option, which starts the purchase wizard and lets you add more items to the agreement. For instructions, see [How to Add Items to your Agreement](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/marketplace-for-clients/add-items-to-an-agreement.md). &#x20;

The details page is divided into the following tabs:

* **General** - Displays the general information for the agreement.&#x20;

The estimated sales price per month and year, along with the subscription status is also displayed.
