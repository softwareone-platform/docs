# Agreements

An agreement is a record that establishes the terms and conditions of a transaction in the Marketplace.&#x20;

It defines the relationship between different objects, such as buyers, sellers, and licensees, and serves as the foundation for placing orders and creating subscriptions on the platform.&#x20;

You can view and manage your agreements from the **Agreements** page in the platform.

At the top of the details page, you can see general details of the agreement.&#x20;

The details page also contains tabs that give you all of the information about the agreement. The following table lists these tabs:

<table><thead><tr><th width="176">Tab</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>General</strong> </td><td>Displays the general information for the agreement. </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Subscriptions</strong></td><td>Displays all subscriptions within the agreement and the details of those subscriptions.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>One-time purchase</strong> </td><td>Shows your one-time purchases.
