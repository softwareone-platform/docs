# Agreements

An agreement is a record that establishes the terms and conditions of a transaction in the Marketplace.&#x20;

It defines the relationship between different objects, such as buyers, sellers, and licensees, and serves as the foundation for placing orders and creating subscriptions on the platform.&#x20;

### Viewing agreements

To view your agreements, navigate to the **Agreements** page. When you launch the **Agreements** page, all agreements in your account are displayed.&#x20;
