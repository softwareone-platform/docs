# Agreement States

In the Marketplace Platform, an agreement can have several states (also known as status).&#x20;

The following diagram shows the possible states and the transition between these states:

These states are displayed as **Status** within the platform. They are also shown beside the agreement name and ID on the details page.

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th width="152">State</th><th>Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Draft</strong></td><td>The agreement is saved as a draft because the purchase order is saved for later during the ordering process.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Deleted</strong></td><td>The draft agreement has been deleted because the draft purchase order associated with the agreement was deleted.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Provisioning</strong></td><td>The agreement has been sent to the vendor and it is pending fulfilment.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Failed</strong></td><td>The agreement has failed because the vendor or SoftwareOne canceled the purchase order.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Active</strong></td><td><p>The vendor has completed the purchase order and the agreement is now active.</p><p></p><p>Active agreements have at least one active subscription and no open orders.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Updating</strong></td><td>A business transaction or a change order is in progress for at least one subscription in the agreement.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Terminated</strong></td><td><p>The agreement has been terminated. </p><p></p><p>It no longer contains active subscriptions.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
