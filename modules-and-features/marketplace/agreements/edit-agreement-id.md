# Edit Agreement ID

When you create a new agreement, the Marketplace Platform assigns a default ID to the agreement. You can change the default ID and assign a new ID so you can identify and manage the agreement easily.

{% hint style="info" %}
Updating an agreement's ID is optional. If you choose not to update the ID, the platform will use the default ID.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to update the agreement ID:

1. On the **Agreements** page (**Marketplace** > **Agreements**), select the agreement to edit. The details page of your selected agreement opens.
