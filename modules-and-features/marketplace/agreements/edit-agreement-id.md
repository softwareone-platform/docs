# Update Additional Client ID

The **Additional Client ID** field on the agreement details page lets you enter a purchase order number that will be displayed on your invoice.&#x20;

When you create an agreement, the **Additional Client ID** field is initially empty. You can update this field with a value for billing and invoicing purposes.

## Updating the additional client ID

To update the **Additional Client ID** field:

1. Navigate to the **Agreements** page.
2. Select the link for the agreement in the **Agreement** column.&#x20;
3. On the agreement details page, select the **Details** tab. Then, select **Edit**.&#x20;

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (946).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Use the Edit option on the Details tab to update the additional client ID. </p></figcaption></figure></div>

4. In the **Edit ID** dialog, enter the new client ID, then select **Save**.&#x20;

The updated ID is displayed as a **Client ID** under **Additional IDs**. This same ID is also displayed on your invoice as the **PO number**.&#x20;

If the value exceeds 20 characters, only the first 16 characters are shown on the invoice, followed by 3 dots (...). For more information, see [Understand Your Billing Documents.](../../billing/understand-your-billing-documents/)
