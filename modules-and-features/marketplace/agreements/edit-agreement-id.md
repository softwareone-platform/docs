# Add or Update Additional Client ID

You can use the **Additional Client ID** field on the agreement details page to enter a purchase order number for billing and invoicing purposes.

When saved, this number is displayed in your invoice header. For details, see the [Invoice header](../../billing/understand-your-billing-documents/#invoice-header) section in [Understand Your Billing Documents](../../billing/understand-your-billing-documents/).  If you entered a value when placing the order, the same value can also be updated.

### Adding or updating the additional client ID

To add or update the Additional Client ID for an order:

1. Navigate to the **Agreements** page, then select the required agreement.
2. On the agreement details page, select the **Details** tab, then select **Edit**.&#x20;

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (946).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Use the Edit option on the Details tab to update the additional client ID. </p></figcaption></figure></div>

3. In the **Edit ID** dialog, add or update the client ID, then select **Save**.&#x20;

The updated ID is displayed as a **Client ID** under **Additional IDs**. This same ID is also displayed on your invoice as the **PO number**.&#x20;

If the value exceeds 20 characters, only the first 16 characters are shown on the invoice, followed by 3 dots (...). For more information, see [Understand Your Billing Documents.](../../billing/understand-your-billing-documents/)
