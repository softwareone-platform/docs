# Assets

The **Assets** page in the platform displays a list of your assets, also called one-time purchase items or perpetual licenses, within the Marketplace Platform.

One-time items are those that are purchased once without any renewal or commitment period. Unlike subscription items that require ongoing payments to keep the license active, a perpetual license remains valid indefinitely and doesn't require recurring payments.&#x20;

### Viewing assets <a href="#ariaid-title1" id="ariaid-title1"></a>

To view your one-time purchased items, navigate to the **Assets** page. Your list of assets is also displayed on the **Assets** tab within the [order details](../orders/#order-details) and [agreement details](../agreements/#subscription-details) pages.

When you launch the **Assets** page, all one-time items you have ordered through the Marketplace are displayed. The table provides information, such as the asset name, linked agreement, key entities, estimated sales price, and status.&#x20;

You can use the [sort and filter options](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md) to customize the list and [show or hide specific columns](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md#managing-columns) as needed.&#x20;

### Viewing asset details <a href="#subscription-details" id="subscription-details"></a>

On the asset details page, you can view extended information for your selected asset. Some information on the details page is read-only, while other information includes links that allow you to navigate to further details.

To view the details page for an asset:

1. Navigate to the **Assets** page.
2. (Optional) Use filters to find the desired asset.
3. Select the asset name to view information, such as product name, billing model, the estimated sales price, base currency, and more.

{% hint style="info" %}
For assets, the billing model is always **one-time** because one-time items don't include any commitment terms or billing periods. For information on the billing models, see this FAQ: [What billing models does Marketplace support for items?](../../../help-and-support/faqs/what-billing-models-does-marketplace-support-for-items.md).
{% endhint %}

4. Use the following tabs to access additional related information:
   * **General** - Displays the most up-to-date information for the asset.&#x20;
   * **Entitlements** - Displays [entitlements](../entitlements/) (meaning, the items you have purchased and the associated quantity) and details, including status, unit price, and estimated sales price (SPx1).
   * **Parameters** - Displays the parameters associated with the asset.&#x20;
   * **Orders** - Displays the purchase order under which the item was purchased.
   * **Details** - Displays reference details, including additional IDs and timestamps. You can edit the additional client ID for the asset using the **Edit** option.
