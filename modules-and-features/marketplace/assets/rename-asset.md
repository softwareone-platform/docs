# Rename Asset

You can rename your one-time purchased item from the asset's details page. Only the assets in the **Active** state can be renamed.

When selecting a new name, we recommend choosing a name that makes it easier for you to search for or locate the asset quickly in your list.

Additionally, ensure that the new name is not blank; otherwise, the platform displays a message.
