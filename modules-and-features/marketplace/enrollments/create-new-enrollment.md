# Create New Enrollment

The **Programs** page in the Marketplace Platform displays all active programs available for enrollment.&#x20;

To enroll in a program, you'll need to create an enrollment request and include your organization's name, email address, and website URL in the request. Your request will then be submitted to the vendor for approval.

## Creating a new enrollment request

To create a new enrollment request:

1. On the **Programs** page, select the program you wish to enroll in. The program's details page opens.
2. On the **Certificates** tab, click **Add**.

   2.  Choose **Request new certificate**.&#x20;

   3. Enter the essential business information, including your organization's name, email address, and website.&#x20;
   4. Verify the details and click **Request** to submit the enrollment request to the vendor.&#x20;
   5. Click **View** to go to the **Certificates** page. Otherwise, click **Close**.&#x20;

A certificate is created with a Pending status, and the new enrollment request appears on the **Enrollments** page.&#x20;

If your enrollment is approved by the vendor, the certificate's status changes to **Active** and you can use this certificate when ordering products and services through the platform.
