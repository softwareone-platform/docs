# Renew Your Enrollment

If your enrollment for a program has expired and your certificate is no longer valid, you can re-enroll in the program. By re-enrolling, you can access the products available within the program and continue enjoying the benefits associated with the program.

You can re-enroll in a program only if your certificate has expired. If your certificate has been terminated, renewing the enrollment isn't possible.

## Renewing an enrollment

Follow these steps to renew your program enrollment:

1. Navigate to the **Certificates** page in the platform.
2. From your list of certificates, search for and then select the expired certificate you want to renew.
3. On the certificate details page, select **Re-enroll** in the upper right. The **Re-enroll** **certificate** wizard opens.
4. Do the following:
   1. Review the pages in the wizard and update the details as necessary.
   2. On the **Overview** page, click **Request** to submit your enrollment request to the vendor. This submission indicates that you have provided the necessary information as per the program's criteria.

When you submit the request, a new enrollment request is created with a **Processing** status. You can view this enrollment on the **Enrollments** page in the platform.&#x20;

Your certificate's status also changes from **Expired** to **Updating**. The certificate's status changes to **Active** after the vendor approves your re-enrollment request.
