# Enrollments

In the Marketplace Platform, enrollment is the process of registering in a specific vendor program.&#x20;

Enrolling in a program makes you eligible for all benefits and incentives associated with that program. The benefits may include reduced pricing, special offers, renewal discounts, and so on.

To enroll in a program, you must fulfill all specified requirements, which may include submitting necessary documentation or meeting certain criteria established by the vendor. If you meet all the requirements, the vendor enrolls you in the program and issues a certificate.&#x20;

The process of enrolling in a program through the Marketplace Platform involves the following steps:

1. Select the program from the catalog on the [Programs ](../programs.md)page.
2. Provide information according to the program's parameters, including your partner details.&#x20;
3. Review and submit the enrollment request to the vendor.&#x20;
   * If your request is approved, you'll receive a certificate.
   * If the vendor requires more information to process your enrollment, your request will move to the **Querying** state. The [enrollment details page](./#subscription-details) will specify the information you must provide.
   * If you don't meet the program's criteria or requirements, your enrollment request is rejected.

You can view all your enrollments on the **Enrollments** page in the platform.
