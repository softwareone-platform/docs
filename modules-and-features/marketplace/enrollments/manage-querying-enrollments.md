# Manage Querying Enrollments

In some cases, a vendor may request that you provide additional information regarding your enrollment. You may also be required to complete some steps before your enrollment can be approved by the vendor.&#x20;

To identify and take action on such enrollments:

1. Navigate to the **Enrollments** page on the platform.
2. From your list of enrollments, select the enrollment in a **Querying** status. If required, [use filters](../../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/marketplace-for-clients/how-to-filter-your-orders.md) to find the relevant enrollment.
3. On the enrollment details page, read the message in the header and within the **General** tab, and take action as indicated in the message. The following image shows an example:

4. Select **Process** to submit the completed enrollment to the vendor for processing. The enrollment's status will change from **Querying** to **Pending**.
