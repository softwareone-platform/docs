## Viewing special quotes

On the Special Quotes page, you can search for a quote and view high-level information, such as your quote history, request status, type, and more.&#x20;

To view the detailed quote information:

1. Locate the quote you wish to view.
2. Select **View** from the **Actions** column. The quote details are displayed on the Special Quote Detail page.

Note that if your special quote contains multiple products, each product request is displayed in a separate row on the Special Quotes page. For example, if your special quote is for Acrobat Professional and Acrobat Standard, both products are displayed separately on the Special Quotes page, even though they are a part of the same request.&#x20;
