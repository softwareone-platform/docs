# Create Approval Groups

Only administrators can create new approval groups. If another person wants to create workflows, either the administrator can enable access for that person, or the individual can contact their SoftwareOne Account Manager.

## Creating a new approval group

To create an approval group:

1. Navigate to **Procurement** > **Purchase Approval Setup**.
2. On the **Purchase Approval Setup** page, select **New Group**.&#x20;
3. In **Create Approval Group**, provide the following details:
   1. **Name** - Enter a name for the group.
   2. **Approval Level** - Choose an approval level from the list. You can create up to 3 levels of purchase approval groups.
   3. **Login(s)** - Select members that you want to add to the group.&#x20;
4. Select **Create**. The group is created, and a confirmation message is displayed.&#x20;
