# Software Assets

With Software Asset Spend Management, you can efficiently oversee and manage your software asset spending across your organization. You can export your software assets to the other Software Asset Management (SAM) tools and import software assets, including those not procured through SoftwareOne.

The Software Assets module, offered as part of Cloud Managed Services, allows you to manage your software assets and inventory for software purchased through SoftwareOne.&#x20;

To access the module, navigate to the main menu and select **Inventory** > **Software Assets**.
