# Invoices

{% hint style="info" %}
All Marketplace invoices are now available under **Billing** > **Invoices**. See [Invoices](../billing/invoices/) to learn more.
{% endhint %}

The Invoices module allows you to search for and view your invoices. You can also export your invoices to the available formats, including PDF and Excel, and create a report of your invoices.&#x20;

## Finding and viewing invoices

The **Invoices** page contains filters to help you locate the invoice you want to view. You can find an invoice using:

* Reference Number
* Document Date
* Invoice Status
* Sell To Address
* Shipment Address
* Invoice Address
* SoftwareOne Company

To find and view an invoice:

1. Specify the search parameters and then select **Search**. A list of invoices matching the criteria is displayed. Note that if you have a long list of invoices, you can refine the list based on the filter options.&#x20;
2. To view an invoice, select the row or select **View** from the **Actions** column. The details page for the invoice opens.

On the **Invoice Details** page, you can view further information about the product and pricing information. Additionally, you can:

* View a history of the transaction and link to more details.
* View the contracts associated with this transaction.
* Download the information as a PDF.

## Exporting invoices

You can export an individual invoice or all of your invoices.

To export an invoice:

1. On the **Invoices** page, use the search filters to find the invoice you want to export.
2. Select the actions icon (•••)  and choose one of these options - **Export to PDF**, **Export to Excel (CSV)**, or **Export to Excel (XLSX)**. A confirmation message is displayed.

Follow these steps to export all of your invoices:

1. On the **Invoices** page, hover over the **Exports** option and select **Invoices**. The **Create New Report - Invoices** page opens.
2. Choose the format for your report, the schedule frequency, and specify the start and the expiration date of your invoice.&#x20;
3. Select a template and provide a name for your report. If you don't want to use any template, choose **None** from the list.&#x20;
4. Choose the delivery method and then select **Run** or **Create**, depending on whether you are creating a run once or a scheduled report.

Once your export completes, you can view it by hovering over **Exports** and selecting **Go to My Reports**. This link will take you directly to your generated reports page.&#x20;
