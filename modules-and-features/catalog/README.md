# Catalog

The **Catalog** module within the Marketplace Platform centralizes all features related to catalog management, making it easier to make purchasing decisions by consolidating product data, prices, and items.

You can access a catalog of software products, view a list of purchasable items available to your organization, and explore detailed pricing structures based on your organization's buying entities and the authorized SoftwareOne sellers.

To get started, see the following link:

{% content-ref url="products.md" %}
[products.md](products.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
