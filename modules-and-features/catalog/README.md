# Catalog

The **Catalog** module within the Marketplace Platform centralizes all features related to catalog management, making it easier to make purchasing decisions by consolidating product data, prices, and items.

You can access a catalog of software products, view a list of purchasable items available to your organization, and explore detailed pricing structures based on your organization's buying entities and the authorized SoftwareOne sellers.
