# Items

In the Marketplace Platform, an item refers to an individual stock-keeping unit (SKU) within a product. Items are part of a product, and they have their own specific name, billing model, commitment term, and billing period.&#x20;

Additionally, a product can contain one or more items. For example, the _Microsoft 365 Business, Enterprise & Apps - Commercial_ product can include different items, such as Microsoft 365 Business Premium (1-year commitment, annual billing), Microsoft 365 Business Basic (no Teams, 3-year commitment, yearly billing), Microsoft Teams Enterprise (1-month commitment, monthly billing), and more.&#x20;

You can view the available items on the **Items** page. Items cannot be ordered on their own; they must be added to an order during a purchase order or a change order workflow. During the ordering process, all available items are displayed so you can choose which ones to add to your order.

### Viewing items

To view a list of items:

1. Navigate to the **Items** page.
2. On the **Items** page, browse the available items. You can [customize columns](../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md#managing-columns) and [apply filters](../../marketplace-platform/getting-started/interface/customize-the-data-grid.md#filtering-data) according to the item name, product name, vendor, billing model, billing period, and commitment term.

3. To view detailed item information, select the item name. You can then view the full item description and associated price lists.

### Ordering items

Items can only be ordered while creating a purchase order or submitting a change order for an existing agreement.&#x20;

During the item selection step, all available items are displayed, so you can choose and add them to your order as needed.
