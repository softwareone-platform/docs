# Items

In the Marketplace Platform, an item is an individual stock-keeping unit (SKU) in a product. Items are part of a product, and they can have their own specific name, term, and commitment.&#x20;

Additionally, there can be one or more items in a product. For example, the _Microsoft 365 Business, Enterprise & Apps - Commercial_ product can include different items, such as Microsoft 365 Business Premium (1-year commitment, annual billing), Microsoft 365 Business Basic (no Teams, 3-year commitment, yearly billing), Microsoft Teams Enterprise (1-month commitment, monthly billing), and more.&#x20;

SoftwareOne clients and partners can view the list of items in the platform and purchase them when placing an order.&#x20;
