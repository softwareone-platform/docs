# View Charges

Your Marketplace billing statements include all charges used to generate an invoice for the specified billing period.&#x20;

Charges are the individual billing transactions used to generate an invoice for a billing period. Each charge on your statement corresponds to a transaction related to the subscriptions in your agreement. Viewing these helps you verify and understand the composition of your total invoice

### Viewing charges

You can see the charges for a statement in two ways:

* **Inside the Excel Billing Statement (.xlsx)** - The **Charges tab** in your statement lists all individual charges.&#x20;
* **Directly in the Marketplace Platform** - The details page of a statement within the platform displays all individual charges. &#x20;

To view the charges directly in the Marketplace Platform:

1. Navigate to the **Statements** page.
2. (Optional) Refine your list of statements by applying filters. For details, see [Filter Billing Statements](filter-billing-statements.md).
3. Find the statement you want, then select the link in the **ID** column. The statement details page opens, and all individual charges are displayed on the **Charges** tab.&#x20;
4. To view the extended information for a specific charge, select **View details** in the **Actions** column.
