# View Charges

Your Marketplace billing statements include all the charges used to generate an invoice for the specified billing period.&#x20;

Each charge on your statement corresponds to a transaction related to the subscriptions in your agreement. You can use the list of charges to understand the composition of your invoice and verify each charge.&#x20;

## Viewing charges

You can view the charges in two ways:

* On the **Charges** tab in your Excel statement. To download or view a sample Excel statement that shows how the charges appear, see the [Billing statements](../understand-your-billing-documents/#billing-statements) section.
* On the statement details page in the platform.&#x20;

To view the charges in the platform:

1. Navigate to the **Statements** page.
2. (Optional) Refine your list of statements by applying filters. For details, see [Filter Billing Statements](filter-billing-statements.md).
3. Find the statement you want, then select the link in the **ID** column. The statement details page opens, and all individual charges are displayed on the **Charges** tab.&#x20;
4. To view the extended information for a specific charge, select **View details** in the **Actions** column.
